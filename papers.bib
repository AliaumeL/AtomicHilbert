  abstract     = {We develop a theory of vector spaces spanned by orbit-finite sets. Using this theory, we give a decision procedure for equivalence of weighted register automata, which are the common generalization of weighted automata and register automata for infinite alphabets. The algorithm runs in exponential time, and in polynomial time for a fixed number of registers. As a special case, we can decide, with the same complexity, language equivalence for unambiguous register automata, which improves previous results in three ways: (a) we allow for order comparisons on atoms, and not just equality; (b) the complexity is exponentially better; and (c) we allow automata with guessing.},

  abstract     = {Summary
                  An algorithm is described which is capable of solving certain word problems: i.e. of deciding whether or not two words composed of variables and operators can be proved equal as a consequence of a given set of identities satisfied by the operators. Although the general word problem is well known to be unsolvable, this algorithm provides results in many interesting cases. For example in elementary group theory if we are given the binary operator ·, the unary operator −, and the nullary operator e, the algorithm is capable of deducing from the three identities a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c, a · a− = e, a · e = a, the laws a− · a = e, e · a = a, a– = a, etc.; and furthermore it can show that a · b = b · a− is not a consequence of the given axioms. The method is based on a well-ordering of the set of all words, such that each identity can be construed as a “reduction”, in the sense that the right-hand side of the identity represents a word smaller in the ordering than the left-hand side. A set of reduction identities is said to be “complete” when two words are equal as a consequence of the identities if and only if they reduce to the same word by a series of reductions. The method used in this algorithm is essentially to test whether a given set of identities is complete; if it is not complete the algorithm in many cases finds a new consequence of the identities which can be added to the list. The process is repeated until either a complete set is achieved or until an anomalous situation occurs which cannot at present be handled. Results of several computational experiments using the algorithm are given.},

abstract = {Given an ideal I and a polynomial f the Ideal Membership Problem (IMP) is to test if f ϵ I. This problem is a fundamental algorithmic problem with important applications and notoriously intractable.We study the complexity of the IMP for combinatorial ideals that arise from constrained problems over the Boolean domain. As our main result, we identify the borderline of tractability. By using Gr\"{o}bner bases techniques, we extend Schaefer’s dichotomy theorem [STOC, 1978] which classifies all Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) over the Boolean domain to be either in P or NP-hard. Moreover, our result implies necessary and sufficient conditions for the efficient computation of Theta Body Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) relaxations, identifying therefore the borderline of tractability for constraint language problems.This article is motivated by the pursuit of understanding the recently raised issue of bit complexity of Sum-of-Squares (SoS) proofs [O’Donnell, ITCS, 2017]. Raghavendra and Weitz [ICALP, 2017] show how the IMP tractability for combinatorial ideals implies bounded coefficients in SoS proofs.},

abstract = {Let F[X] be the polynomial ring in the variables X = {x1,x2,…,xn} over a field F. An ideal I = 〈p1(x1),…,pn(xn)〉 generated by univariate polynomials {pi(xi)}i=1n is a univariate ideal. Motivated by Alon’s Combinatorial Nullstellensatz we study the complexity of univariate ideal membership: Given f∈F[X] by a circuit and polynomials pi the problem is test if f ∈ I. We obtain the following results. 
Suppose f is a degree-d, rank-r polynomial given by an arithmetic circuit where ℓi : 1 ≤ i ≤ r are linear forms in X. We give a deterministic time dO(r) ⋅poly(n) division algorithm for evaluating the (unique) remainder polynomial f(X)modI at any point a→∈Fn. This yields a randomized nO(r) algorithm for minimum vertex cover in graphs with rank-r adjacency matrices. It also yields a new nO(r) algorithm for evaluating the permanent of a n \texttimes{} n matrix of rank r, over any field F.Let f be over rationals with deg(f)=k treated as fixed parameter. When the ideal I=x1e1,…,xnen, we can test ideal membership in randomized O∗((2e)k). On the other hand, if each pi has all distinct rational roots we can check if f ∈ I in randomized O∗(nk/2) time, improving on the brute-force n+kk-time search.If I=p1(x1),…,pk(xk), with k as fixed parameter, then ideal membership testing is W[2]-hard. The problem is MINI[1]-hard in the special case when I=x1e1,…,xkek.},

We will use this approach to solve the forward and inverse kinematic problems of robotics for certain types of robots.",

Our technique uses the theory of ideals over polynomial rings to reduce the non-linear invariant generation problem to a numerical constraint solving problem. So far, the literature on invariant generation has been focussed on the construction of linear invariants for linear programs. Consequently, there has been little progress toward non-linear invariant generation. In this paper, we demonstrate a technique that encodes the conditions for a given template assertion being an invariant into a set of constraints, such that all the solutions to these constraints correspond to non-linear (algebraic) loop invariants of the program. We discuss some trade-offs between the completeness of the technique and the tractability of the constraint-solving problem generated. The application of the technique is demonstrated on a few examples.},

abstract = {An ideal of polynomials is symmetric if it is closed under permutations of variables. We relate general symmetric ideals to the so called Specht ideals generated by all Specht polynomials of a given shape. We show a connection between the leading monomials of polynomials in the ideal and the Specht polynomials contained in the ideal. This provides applications in several contexts. Most notably, this connection gives information about the solutions of the corresponding set of equations. From another perspective, it restricts the isotypic decomposition of the ideal viewed as a representation of the symmetric group.}
