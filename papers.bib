Using this theory, we give a decision procedure for equivalence of weighted register automata, which are the common generalization of weighted automata and register automata for infinite alphabets. The algorithm runs in exponential time, and in polynomial time for a fixed number of registers. As a special case, we can decide, with the same complexity, language equivalence for unambiguous register automata, which improves previous results in three ways: (a) we allow for order comparisons on atoms, and not just equality; (b) the complexity is exponentially better; and (c) we allow automata with guessing.},

  abstract      = {Given an ideal I and a polynomial f the Ideal Membership Problem (IMP) is to test if f ϵ I. This problem is a fundamental algorithmic problem with important applications and notoriously intractable.We study the complexity of the IMP for combinatorial ideals that arise from constrained problems over the Boolean domain. As our main result, we identify the borderline of tractability. By using Gr\"{o}bner bases techniques, we extend Schaefer’s dichotomy theorem [STOC, 1978] which classifies all Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) over the Boolean domain to be either in P or NP-hard. Moreover, our result implies necessary and sufficient conditions for the efficient computation of Theta Body Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) relaxations, identifying therefore the borderline of tractability for constraint language problems.This article is motivated by the pursuit of understanding the recently raised issue of bit complexity of Sum-of-Squares (SoS) proofs [O’Donnell, ITCS, 2017]. Raghavendra and Weitz [ICALP, 2017] show how the IMP tractability for combinatorial ideals implies bounded coefficients in SoS proofs.},

We relate general symmetric ideals to the so called Specht ideals generated by all Specht polynomials of a given shape. We show a connection between the leading monomials of polynomials in the ideal and the Specht polynomials contained in the ideal. This provides applications in several contexts. Most notably, this connection gives information about the solutions of the corresponding set of equations. From another perspective, it restricts the isotypic decomposition of the ideal viewed as a representation of the symmetric group.},

This article is a survey of several aspects of homogeneity, with emphasis on countably infinite homogeneous structures. These arise as Fraissé limits of amalgamation classes of finite structures. The subject has connections to model theory, to permutation group theory, to combinatorics (for example through combinatorial enumeration, and through Ramsey theory), and to descriptive set theory. Recently there has been a focus on connections to topological dynamics, and to constraint satisfaction. The article discusses connections between these topics, with an emphasis on examples, and on special properties of an amalgamation class which yield important consequences for the automorphism group.},

We investigate the effectiveness of his analysis, considering effectively presented lists of finitely generated structures and asking when such a list is the age of a computable structure. We focus particularly on the Fraïssé limit. We also show that degree spectra of relations on a sufficiently nice Fraïssé limit are always upward closed unless the relation is definable by a quantifier-free formula. We give some sufficient or necessary conditions for a Fraïssé limit to be spectrally universal. As an application, we prove that the computable atomless Boolean algebra is spectrally universal.},

@article{SSM04,
  abstract      = {We present a new technique for the generation of non-linear (algebraic) invariants of a program. Our technique uses the theory of ideals over polynomial rings to reduce the non-linear invariant generation problem to a numerical constraint solving problem. So far, the literature on invariant generation has been focussed on the construction of linear invariants for linear programs. Consequently, there has been little progress toward non-linear invariant generation. In this paper, we demonstrate a technique that encodes the conditions for a given template assertion being an invariant into a set of constraints, such that all the solutions to these constraints correspond to non-linear (algebraic) loop invariants of the program. We discuss some trade-offs between the completeness of the technique and the tractability of the constraint-solving problem generated. The application of the technique is demonstrated on a few examples.},

In practice for most examples there is no reduction to zero. We illustrate this algorithm by one detailed example.},

In {\textsection}{\textsection}1 and 2, we will prove the Nullstellensatz, a celebrated theorem which identifies exactly which ideals correspond to varieties. This will allow us to construct a ``dictionary'' between geometry and algebra, whereby any statement about varieties can be translated into a statement about ideals (and conversely). We will pursue this theme in {\textsection}{\textsection}3 and 4, where we will define a number of natural algebraic operations on ideals and study their geometric analogues.",

In this chapter, we will study the method of Gr{\"o}bner bases, which will allow us to solve problems about polynomial ideals in an algorithmic or computational fashion. The method of Gr{\"o}bner bases is also used in several powerful computer algebra systems to study specific polynomial ideals that arise in applications. In Chapter 1, we posed many problems concerning the algebra of polynomial ideals and the geometry of affine varieties. In this chapter and the next, we will focus on four of these problems.",
