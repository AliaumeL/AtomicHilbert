  abstract = {This paper introduces a new efficient algorithm for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases. We replace the Buchberger criteria by an optimal criteria. We give a proof that the resulting algorithm (called F5) generates no useless critical pairs if the input is a regular sequence. This a new result by itself but a first implementation of the algorithm F5 shows that it is also very efficient in practice: for instance previously untractable problems can be solved (cyclic 10). In practice for most examples there is no reduction to zero. We illustrate this algorithm by one detailed example.},

Using this theory, we give a decision procedure for equivalence of weighted register automata, which are the common generalization of weighted automata and register automata for infinite alphabets. The algorithm runs in exponential time, and in polynomial time for a fixed number of registers. As a special case, we can decide, with the same complexity, language equivalence for unambiguous register automata, which improves previous results in three ways: (a) we allow for order comparisons on atoms, and not just equality; (b) the complexity is exponentially better; and (c) we allow automata with guessing.},

  abstract      = {Given an ideal I and a polynomial f the Ideal Membership Problem (IMP) is to test if f ϵ I. This problem is a fundamental algorithmic problem with important applications and notoriously intractable.We study the complexity of the IMP for combinatorial ideals that arise from constrained problems over the Boolean domain. As our main result, we identify the borderline of tractability. By using Gr\"{o}bner bases techniques, we extend Schaefer’s dichotomy theorem [STOC, 1978] which classifies all Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) over the Boolean domain to be either in P or NP-hard. Moreover, our result implies necessary and sufficient conditions for the efficient computation of Theta Body Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) relaxations, identifying therefore the borderline of tractability for constraint language problems.This article is motivated by the pursuit of understanding the recently raised issue of bit complexity of Sum-of-Squares (SoS) proofs [O’Donnell, ITCS, 2017]. Raghavendra and Weitz [ICALP, 2017] show how the IMP tractability for combinatorial ideals implies bounded coefficients in SoS proofs.},

We relate general symmetric ideals to the so called Specht ideals generated by all Specht polynomials of a given shape. We show a connection between the leading monomials of polynomials in the ideal and the Specht polynomials contained in the ideal. This provides applications in several contexts. Most notably, this connection gives information about the solutions of the corresponding set of equations. From another perspective, it restricts the isotypic decomposition of the ideal viewed as a representation of the symmetric group.},

We will use this approach to solve the forward and inverse kinematic problems of robotics for certain types of robots.",

  abstract      = {A relational first order structure is homogeneous if it is countable (possibly finite) and every isomorphism between finite substructures extends to an automorphism. This article is a survey of several aspects of homogeneity, with emphasis on countably infinite homogeneous structures. These arise as Fraissé limits of amalgamation classes of finite structures. The subject has connections to model theory, to permutation group theory, to combinatorics (for example through combinatorial enumeration, and through Ramsey theory), and to descriptive set theory. Recently there has been a focus on connections to topological dynamics, and to constraint satisfaction. The article discusses connections between these topics, with an emphasis on examples, and on special properties of an amalgamation class which yield important consequences for the automorphism group.},

We investigate the effectiveness of his analysis, considering effectively presented lists of finitely generated structures and asking when such a list is the age of a computable structure. We focus particularly on the Fraïssé limit. We also show that degree spectra of relations on a sufficiently nice Fraïssé limit are always upward closed unless the relation is definable by a quantifier-free formula. We give some sufficient or necessary conditions for a Fraïssé limit to be spectrally universal. As an application, we prove that the computable atomless Boolean algebra is spectrally universal.},

Consequently, there has been little progress toward non-linear invariant generation. In this paper, we demonstrate a technique that encodes the conditions for a given template assertion being an invariant into a set of constraints, such that all the solutions to these constraints correspond to non-linear (algebraic) loop invariants of the program.

  abstract      = {Summary
                   An algorithm is described which is capable of solving certain word problems: i.e. of deciding whether or not two words composed of variables and operators can be proved equal as a consequence of a given set of identities satisfied by the operators. Although the general word problem is well known to be unsolvable, this algorithm provides results in many interesting cases. For example in elementary group theory if we are given the binary operator ·, the unary operator −, and the nullary operator e, the algorithm is capable of deducing from the three identities a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c, a · a− = e, a · e = a, the laws a− · a = e, e · a = a, a– = a, etc.; and furthermore it can show that a · b = b · a− is not a consequence of the given axioms. The method is based on a well-ordering of the set of all words, such that each identity can be construed as a “reduction”, in the sense that the right-hand side of the identity represents a word smaller in the ordering than the left-hand side. A set of reduction identities is said to be “complete” when two words are equal as a consequence of the identities if and only if they reduce to the same word by a series of reductions. The method used in this algorithm is essentially to test whether a given set of identities is complete; if it is not complete the algorithm in many cases finds a new consequence of the identities which can be added to the list. The process is repeated until either a complete set is achieved or until an anomalous situation occurs which cannot at present be handled. Results of several computational experiments using the algorithm are given.},
