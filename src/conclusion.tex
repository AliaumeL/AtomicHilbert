\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proven that the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} is decidable
under classical effective assumptions on the group action and the
representation of the set of indeterminates, and under a mild hypothesis on the
behavior of monomials. Furthermore, we have developed an algorithm that
computes an \kl{equivariant Gröbner basis} of an \kl{equivariant ideal}, and
shown that it provides an effective representation to work with ideals
(allowing us to compute unions, intersections, etc.) under a slightly stronger
hypothesis on the divisibility ordering. Finally, we have discussed how the
classical counter-examples to our assumptions on the behavior of monomials can
be turned into undecidability results for the \kl{equivariant ideal membership
problem}. Let us now discuss the main open questions raised by
the present paper.

\paragraph*{Total orderings.} We assumed that the indeterminates $\Indets$ were
equipped with a total ordering $\varleq$. This assumption seems necessary, as
the notions of \kl{leading monomials} would cease to be well-defined without
it. However, we do not have a clear understanding of whether this assumption is
vacuous or not. Indeed, as noticed by \cite[Lemma 13]{GHOLAS24}, and
\cref{lem:reducts-equiv-hilbert}, it often suffices to extend the
structures of the indeterminates to account for a total ordering. A conjecture
of Pouzet \todo{cite} states that such an ordering always exists, and this was
remarked by \cite[Remark 14]{GHOLAS24}. Note that in this case, one would 
\todo[inline]{complete this}

\paragraph*{All our hypotheses and Pouzet in the middle.} We conjecture that
$(\mon{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$ is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering} if and only if
$(\mon[Y]{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$ is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering} for every
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} set $Y$ of exponents. This is a form of Pouzet's
conjecture, which has been verified on some classes of structures.

\paragraph*{Undecidability.} It would be nice to obtain a dichotomy result
for the decidability, but it seems beyond reach for now.
talk about VASS here  for coverability.

\paragraph*{Complexity.} We do not have complexity lower bounds, and there may
be better algorithms like adaptations of Faugère's algorithm that could be
better in practice.
