\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\todo[inline]{Write it}

\paragraph*{Total orderings.} they seem necessary.

\paragraph*{All our hypotheses and Pouzet in the middle.} we believe everything
is true.

\paragraph*{Undecidability.} It would be nice to obtain a dichotomy result
for the decidability, but it seems beyond reach for now.
talk about VASS here  for coverability

\paragraph*{Applications.} also talk about complexity ?
