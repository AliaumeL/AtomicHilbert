\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have given a sufficient condition for \kl{equivariant Gröbner bases} to be
computable, under natural \kl{computability assumptions}, and we have shown
that our sufficient condition is close to being optimal since the
undecidability of the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} can be derived
for a large class of group actions that do not satisfy our condition.
Let us now discuss some open questions and conjectures that arise from our work.

\paragraph{Total orderings on the set of indeterminates} We assumed that the
indeterminates $\Indets$ were equipped with a total ordering $\varleq$ that is
preserved by the group action. This assumption seems necessary, as the notions
of \kl{leading monomials} would cease to be well-defined without it. However,
we do not have a clear understanding of whether this assumption is vacuous or
not. Indeed, as noticed by \cite[Lemma 13]{GHOLAS24}, and
\cref{lem:reducts-equiv-hilbert}, it often suffices to extend the structures of
the indeterminates to account for a total ordering. A conjecture of Pouzet
\cite[Problems 12]{POUZ24} states that such an ordering always exists, and this
was remarked by \cite[Remark 14]{GHOLAS24}. Note that in this case, one would
get a complete characterisation of the group actions for which the
\kl{equivariant Hilbert basis property} holds \cite[Property 4]{GHOLAS24}.

\paragraph{Labelled well-quasi-orderings and dichotomy conjectures} As noted in
\Cref{sec:undecidability}, there are many conjectures relating the fact that
$(\mon[Y]{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$ is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering} (for every
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} set $Y$) and the presence of long
paths of some king (\cref{conj:wqo-infinite-path,rem:conj-wqo-infinite-path}).
In particular, Pouzet's conjecture \cite{POUZ72} would imply that for actions
arising from \kl{homogeneous structures} (as in the examples given in
\cref{sec:act ex}), \cref{thm:compute-egb} and \cref{thm:undecidable-paths} are
two sides of a dichotomy theorem: either the \kl{equivariant ideal membership
problem} is undecidable and there are \kl{equivariant ideals} that are not
\kl{orbit-finitely generated}, or every \kl{equivariant ideal} is
\kl{orbit-finitely generated} and one can compute \kl{equivariant Gröbner
bases}. Let us note that for some classes of graphs having bounded clique
width, Pouzet's conjecture is known to hold \cite{DRT10,LOPEZ24}.
This leads us to the following conjecture:

\begin{conjecture}
  For every action $\group\actson\Indets$ of a group $\group$ on a set
  of indeterminates that is \kl{effectively oligomorphic}, exactly
  one of the following holds:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} is decidable. 
    \item There exists an \kl{equivariant ideal} that is not
      \kl{orbit-finitely generated}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{conjecture}

Let us point out that a similar conjecture was already stated in the context of
Petri nets with data. Indeed, the condition that $(\mon[Y]{\Indets},\gdivleq)$
is a \kl{WQO} for every \kl{WQO} $Y$ also guarantees coverability of Petri nets
with data $\X$ is decidable \cite[Theorem 1]{Lasota16}, and it was actually
conjectured to be a necessary condition \cite[Conjecture 1]{Lasota16}. 

\paragraph{Complexity} In the present paper, we have focused on the
decidability of the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} and the
computability of \kl{equivariant Gröbner bases}. However, we have not addressed
the complexity of such problems, and have only adapted the most basic
algorithms for computing \kl{Gröbner bases}. 

We do not have complexity lower bounds, and there may
be better algorithms like adaptations of Faugère's algorithm that could be
better in practice.

\paragraph*{Duals of orbit-finitely generated vector spaces} An interesting
question posed by S\l{a}womir Lasota is that whether for group actions
$\group\actson\Indets$ for which $(\mon[Y]{\Indets},\gdivleq)$ is a \kl{WQO},
duals of orbit-finitely generated vector spaces are also orbit-finitely
generated. This follows for the structures in \Cref{ex:eq atoms,ex:dlo} by the
results of \cite{BFKM24,GHL22,Prz23}. Proving it for the general case would be
a big step towards generalising the results of \cite{GHL22}.
