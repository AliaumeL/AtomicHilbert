\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Relationship with conjectures: Pouzet et Co.
    \item Weak GrÃ¶bner Bases -> are the strong ones computable?
    \item Undecidability in a more general setting?
    \item Applications.
\end{itemize}

\section{Things to mention}
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item WQO condition also used for data VAS coverability (WQO dichotomy conjecture)
\item WQO implies existence of orbit-finite bases?
\item Oligomorphic + Non wqo implies undecidability of equivariant ideal membership
\end{enumerate}
