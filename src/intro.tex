\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\AP For a field $\K$ and a non-empty set $\Indets$ of indeterminates, we use
$\poly{\K}{\Indets}$ to denote the ring of polynomials with coefficients from $\K$
and indeterminates/variables from $\Indets$. A fundamental result in commutative
algebra is \intro{Hilbert's basis theorem}, stating that when $\Indets$ is finite,
every ideal in $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$ is finitely generated \cite{HILB1890}, where an
\kl{ideal} is a non-empty subset of $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$ that is closed under
addition and multiplication by elements of $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$. This property can
be rephrased as the fact that the set of polynomials $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$ is
\intro{Noetherian}. \kl{Hilbert's basis theorem} extends to the case where $\K$
is a ring that is itself \kl{Noetherian} \cite[Theorem 4.1]{Lang02}.

\AP A \Grb\ is a specific kind of generating set of a polynomial ideal
which allows easy checking of membership of a given polynomial in that ideal.
\kl{Gr\"{o}bner bases} were introduced by Buchberger who showed when $\Indets$ is
finite, every ideal in $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$ has a finite \kl{Gr\"{o}bner basis} and
that, for a given a set of polynomials in $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$, one can compute a
finite \kl{Gröbner basis} of the ideal generated by them \cite{BUCH76}. The
existence and computability of \Grbs\ implies the decidability of the
\kl{ideal membership problem}: given a polynomial $f$ and set of polynomial
$H$, decide whether $f$ is in the ideal generated by $H$. The theory of
\kl{Gr\"{o}bner bases} has applications in very diverse areas of computer
science, including integer programming \cite{Sturmfels96}, algebraic proof
systems \cite{algProof}, geometric reasoning \cite{Cox2015chGeom}, fixed
parameter tractability \cite{ACDM22}, program analysis \cite{SSM04} and
constraint satisfaction problems \cite{Mas21}.
In automata theory it has been used for deciding zeroness of polynomial
automata \cite{BEDUSHWO17}, reachability in symmetric Petri nets \cite{MAME82},
equivalence for string-to-string transducers \cite{HONKALA00} and equivalence
of polynomial differential equations \cite{CLEMENTE24}. 

\AP There has been a growing interest in the last few years for computational
models that are manipulating infinite data structures in a finite way, for
instance an automaton reading words on the infinite alphabet $\N$, while
maintaining a finite number of states. While this idea can be traced back to
the 90s with the notion of register automata \cite{KAFR94}, it has been revived
in with the development of the theory of \emph{orbit finite sets}. In this
setting, one would like to consider an infinite set of variables $\Indets$. As an
example, let us consider the set $\Indets$ of variables $x_i$ for $i \in \N$, and
the \kl{ideal} $\idlZ$ generated by the set $\setof{x_i}{i \in \N}$. It is
clear that $\idlZ$ is not finitely generated, and we conclude that the
\kl{Hilbert's basis theorem} (and a fortiori, the \kl{Gr\"{o}bner basis}
theory) does not extend to the case of infinite sets of indeterminates.

\AP However, in the applications mentionned above, the infinite set of
variables (data) comes with an extra structure: the behaviour of the considered
systems are invariant under the action of a group $\group$ on $\Indets$. The action
of this $\group$ on $\Indets$ naturally induces an action on $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$, by
renaming the variables. The typical example is the group of all permutations of
$\Indets$, which corresponds to seeing $\Indets$ as a set of \emph{indistinguishable}
names: one is not interested in the ideal $\idlZ$ generated by the set
$\setof{x_i}{i \in \N}$, but rather in the \kl{equivariant ideal} generated by
the set $\setof{x_i}{i \in \N}$, which is the smallest ideal that contains it
and is invariant under the action of $\group$. In this case, this ideal is
finitely generated by a single indeterminate, e.g. $x_1$. Please note that
equivariance does not imply finite generation in general: for instance, the
ideal $\idlZ$ is not finitely generated as an equivariant ideal with respect to
the trivial group.

\AP There has been a growing interest in understanding which groups $\group$
and sets of variables $\Indets$ allow one to extend the \kl{Hilbert's basis theorem}
to the equivariant case,
and to adapt the theory of \kl{Gr\"{o}bner bases} to this setting \cite{BRDR11,HISU12,HIKRLE18,GHOLAS24,COHEN67},
and there is an almost complete characterisation of the pairs $(\Indets,\group)$ for which the \kl{Equivariant Hilbert basis property} \cite[Theorems 11 and 12]{GHOLAS24}.
But to obtain decision procedures, one still lacks a generalisation of \kl{Buchberger's algorithm} to the equivariant case, except under artificial extra assumptions \cite[Section 6]{GHOLAS24}.
Overall, a general understanding of the decidability of the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} is still missing,
and \emph{a fortiori}, a generalisation of \kl{Buchberger's algorithm} to the
equivariant case is still an open problem.

\paragraph{Contributions.} \AP In this paper, we bridge the gap between the
theretical understanding of \kl{Hilbert's basis property} in the equivariant
setting \cite{GHOLAS24}, and the computational aspects of \kl{equivariant
ideals}, by showing that under mild assumptions on the group action, one can
compute an \kl{equivariant Gröbner basis} of an \kl{equivariant ideal}, hence,
that one can decide the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem}. In order to
compute such sets, we will need to introduce some classical \kl{computability
assumptions} on the group action $\group \actson \Indets$, and on the set of
indeterminates $\Indets$. These will be defined in
\cref{sec:preliminaries}, but informally, we assume
that one can compute representatives of the orbits of elements under the action
of $\group$ (this is called \kl{effective oligomorphism}), and that one has
access to a total ordering on $\Indets$ that is computable, and
\kl(ord){compatible} with the action of $\group$. Please note that the ordering
on $\Indets$ is not required to be well-founded, and a typical example of our
computable assumptions would be the set $\Q$ of rationals, equipped with the
natural ordering $\leq$ and the group $\group$ would be the group of all
monotone bijections from $\Q$ to itself.

\AP Let us now focus on the mild semantic assumption that we will need to make
on the set of indeterminates $\Indets$ and the group $\group$, that will
guarantee the termination of our procedures. We refer to our preliminaries
(\cref{sec:preliminaries}) for a more detailed discussion on these assumptions,
but again informally, we ask that the set of \kl{monomials} $\mon{\Indets}$ is
well-behaved with respect to divisibility up to the action of $\group$, which
we write as the fact that $(\mon{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$ is a
\kl{well-quasi-ordering} (\kl{WQO}). It is known from that this is a necessary
condition for the \kl{equivariant Hilbert basis property} to hold
\cite{GHOLAS24}. We will rely on a slightly stronger condition, namely that
$(\mon[Y]{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$ is a \kl{WQO}, whenever $(Y, \leq)$ is one,
which is conjectured to be equivalent to the first condition.

\begin{theorem}[name={Equivariant Gröbner Basis},restate=thm:compute-equiv-gb]
  \label{thm:compute-egb}
  Let $\Indets$ be a totally ordered set of indeterminates
  equipped with a group action $\group \actson \Indets$, under our \kl{computability assumptions}.
  If $(\mon[Y]{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$ is a \kl{WQO} for every 
  \kl{well-quasi-ordered} set $(Y,\leq)$, then one can
  compute an \kl{equivariant Gröbner bases} of \kl{equivariant ideals}.
\end{theorem}

\AP To prove our \cref{thm:compute-egb}, we will first introduce a weaker
notion of \kl{weak equivariant Gröbner basis}, which characterises the results
obtained by naïvely adapting \kl{Buchberger's algorithm} to the equivariant
case. Then, we will show that under our \kl{computability assumptions}, one can
start from a finite set of generators $H$ of an \kl{equivariant ideal}, and
compute a well-chosen \kl{weak equivariant Gröbner basis}, which happens to be
an \kl{equivariant Gröbner basis} of the ideal generated by $H$. As a
consequence, we obtain effective representations of \kl{equivariant ideals},
over which one can check membership, inclusion, and compute the sum and
intersection of \kl{equivariant ideals}
(\cref{cor:equivariant-ideals-computations}).

\AP We then focus on providing undecidability results for the \kl{equivariant
ideal membership problem} in the case where our effective assumptions are
satisfied, but the \kl{well-quasi-ordering} condition is not. This aims at
illustrating the fact that our assumptions are close to optimal. One classical
way for a set of structures to not be \kl{well-quasi-ordered} (when labelled
using integers) is to have the ability to represent an \emph{infinite path} (a
formal definition will be given in
\cref{sec:undecidability}). We prove that
whenever one can (effectively) represent an infinite path in the set of
\kl{monomials} $\mon{\Indets}$, then the \kl{equivariant ideal membership
problem} is undecidable.

\begin{theorem}[name={Undecidability of Equivariant Ideal Membership},restate=thm:undecidable-paths]
  \label{thm:undecidable-paths}
  Let $\Indets$ be a totally ordered set of indeterminates
  equipped with a group action $\group \actson \Indets$, under our \kl{computability assumptions}.
  If $\Indets$ contain an \kl(of){infinite path}
  then the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} is undecidable.
\end{theorem}

As corollaries of
\cref{thm:undecidable-paths},
we obtain numerous examples of cases where the \kl{equivariant ideal membership
problem} is undecidable, such as the case of $\Z$ with the group generated by
the successor function (an instance of
\cref{subsec:paths}), or the case of an
infinite dimensional vector space with the group of all linear bijections
(\cref{subsec:vector})\arka{replace vector spaces with pairs of equality}.


Finally, we illustrate how our positive results find applications in numerous
situations. This is done by providing families indeterminates that satisfy our
\kl{computability assumptions}, and for which we can compute \kl{equivariant
Gröbner bases}, and also by showing how our results can be used in the context
of \kl{topological well-structured transition systems} \cite{JGL10}, with
applications do the verification of infinite state systems such as \kl{orbit
finite weighted automata} \cite{BOKLMO21}, \kl{orbit finite polynomial
automata}, and more generally orbit finite systems dealing with polynomial
computations.

\paragraph{Organisation.} \AP The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In
\cref{sec:preliminaries}, we introduce formally the
notions of \kl{Gröbner bases}, \kl{effectively oligomorphic} sets, and
\kl{well-quasi-orderings}, which are the main assumptions of our positive
results. Then, we will present in \cref{sec:weakgb}
an adaptation of \kl{Buchberger's
algorithm} to the equivariant case, that computes a \kl{weak equivariant
Gröbner basis} of an \kl{equivariant ideal}. This is the central object of our
paper, and will be used to derive our two positive results. In
\cref{sec:equivariant-grobner-basis},
we use \kl{weak equivariant Gröbner bases} to prove our main
\cref{thm:compute-egb}.
Then, we refine our analysis in
\cref{sec:refinements},
we use \kl{weak equivariant Gröbner bases} to devise a decision procedure for
the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} under weaker assumptions
(\cref{thm:decide-equiv-ideal-mem}),
and discuss the potential other applications of \kl{weak equivariant Gröbner
bases}. Then, in
\cref{sec:undecidability}, we show that
our assumptions are close to optimal by proving that the \kl{equivariant ideal
membership problem} is undecidable whenever one can produce a \kl{word
encoding} function (\cref{thm:undecidable-paths}), and we
illustrate this result with a variety of examples. We provide a detailed
discussion on the applications of our positive results in \cref{sec:examples}.
Finally, in \cref{sec:conclusion}, we will
discuss on the need for a total ordering on the set of indeterminates, and the
possibility to relax the hypotheses of our results.
