\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\AP For a field $\K$ and a non-empty set $\Indets$ of indeterminates, we denote
the ring of polynomials with coefficients from $\K$ and indeterminates from $\Indets$
by $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$. A fundamental result in commutative algebra is
\intro{Hilbert's basis theorem}, which states that when $\Indets$ is finite,
every ideal in $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$ is finitely generated~\cite{HILB1890}, where an
\kl{ideal} is a non-empty subset of $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$ that is closed under
addition and multiplication by elements of $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$.
This property follows from 
\kl{Hilbert's basis theorem}, stating that for every ring 
$\A$ that is \intro{Noetherian}, 
the polynomial ring $\poly{\A}{x}$ in one variable over $\A$ is also
\reintro{Noetherian}~\cite[Theorem 4.1]{Lang02}.

\AP In this paper, we assume that elements of $\K$ can be effectively represented
and that basic operations on $\K$ are computable
($+$, $-$, $\times$, $/$, and equality test).
In this setting, a \Grb\ is a specific kind of generating set of a polynomial ideal
which allows easy checking of membership of a given polynomial in that ideal.
\kl{Gröbner bases} were introduced by Buchberger, who showed that when $\Indets$ is
finite, every ideal in $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$ has a finite \kl{Gröbner basis}. Moreover,
for any set of polynomials in $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$, one can compute a
finite \kl{Gröbner basis} of the ideal generated by them via the so-called
\intro{Buchberger algorithm}~\cite{BUCH76}. The
existence and computability of \Grbs\ implies the decidability of the
\kl{ideal membership problem}: given a polynomial $f$ and a set of polynomials
$H$, decide whether $f$ is in the ideal generated by $H$. 
More generally, \kl{Gröbner bases} provide effective representations of ideals,
making it possible to decide inclusion and equality, and to compute sums and intersections
of ideals~\cite{CLO15}.

%The theory of
%\kl{Gr\"{o}bner bases} has applications in very diverse areas of computer
%science, including integer programming \cite{Sturmfels96}, algebraic proof
%systems \cite{algProof}, geometric reasoning \cite{Cox2015chGeom}, fixed
%parameter tractability \cite{ACDM22}, program analysis \cite{SSM04} and
%constraint satisfaction problems \cite{Mas21}.
%In automata theory it has been used for deciding zeroness of polynomial
%automata \cite{BEDUSHWO17}, reachability in symmetric Petri nets \cite{MAME82},
%equivalence for string-to-string transducers \cite{HONKALA00} and equivalence
%of polynomial differential equations \cite{CLEMENTE24}. 

%\AP There has been a growing interest in the last few years for computational
%models that are manipulating infinite data structures in a finite way, for
%instance an automaton reading words on the infinite alphabet $\N$, while
%maintaining a finite number of states. While this idea can be traced back to
%the 90s with the notion of register automata \cite{KAFR94}, it has been revived
%in with the development of the theory of \emph{orbit finite sets}. In this
%setting, one would like to consider an infinite set of variables $\Indets$.
%
%\arka{break in flow}
%As an example, let us consider the set $\Indets$ of variables $x_i$ for $i \in \N$, and
%the \kl{ideal} $\idlZ$ generated by the set $\setof{x_i}{i \in \N}$. It is
%clear that $\idlZ$ is not finitely generated, and we conclude that the
%\kl{Hilbert's basis theorem} (and a fortiori, the \kl{Gr\"{o}bner basis}
%theory) does not extend to the case of infinite sets of indeterminates.

\AP
Beyond their significance in commutative algebra,
these decidability results have important applications in
other areas of computer science. For instance, the so-called
``Hilbert Method'' reduces the verification of certain problems on automata and
transducers to computations on polynomial ideals and has been successfully applied
to polynomial automata and the equivalence of string-to-string transducers
of linear growth. We refer to~\cite{BOJAN19} for a survey of these applications.

\AP
This paper extends the theory of \kl{Gröbner bases} to the case where
the set $\Indets$ of indeterminates is infinite.
As an example, consider $\Indets$ to be the
set of variables $x_i$ for $i \in \N$, and
the \kl{ideal} $\idlZ$ generated by the set $\setof{x}{x \in \Indets}$.
Clearly, $\idlZ$ is not finitely generated. Consequently,
\kl{Hilbert's basis theorem} and, a fortiori, the theory of
\kl{Gröbner bases}
do not extend to the case of infinite sets of indeterminates.

\AP
Fortunately, the infinite set $\Indets$ of
variables (data) often comes with additional structure,
typically given by relations and functions defined on $\Indets$,
and one is often interested in systems that are invariant
under the action of the group $\group$ of structure-preserving
bijections of $\Indets$.
For instance, in the above example,
one may not be interested in the ideal $\idlZ$ generated by the set
$\setof{x}{x \in \Indets}$,
but rather in the \kl{equivariant ideal} generated by
the set $\setof{x}{x \in \Indets}$,
which is the smallest ideal that contains it and is invariant
under the action of $\group$.
In this case, the ideal is finitely generated by any single
indeterminate $x \in \Indets$.
This motivates the study of \kl{equivariant ideals},
which are highly dependent on the specific choice of group action
$\group \actson \Indets$:
for instance, the ideal $\idlZ$ is not finitely generated as an equivariant
ideal with respect to the trivial group. 
A general analysis of the \kl{equivariant Hilbert basis property}
stating that
``every \kl{equivariant ideal} is orbit finitely generated''
has been recently given in \cite{GHOLAS24},
and this paper aims at providing a computational counterpart.




\subsection{Contributions.} \AP In this paper, we bridge the gap between the
theoretical understanding of the \intro{equivariant Hilbert basis property}
\cite[Property 4]{GHOLAS24}, and the computational aspects of \kl{equivariant
ideals}, by showing that under mild assumptions on the group action, one can
compute an \kl{equivariant Gröbner basis} of an \kl{equivariant ideal}, hence,
that one can decide the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem}. 

\AP We divide our hypotheses into two parts. First, we require
\kl{computability assumptions} to be satisfied by the group action, which are
fairly standard in the literature on computation with infinite data. Second, we
require a semantic assumption on the set of indeterminates that will
guarantee the termination of our procedures, which we call being
\kl{well-structured}. This implies that the set of monomials is
\kl{well-quasi-ordered} with respect to divisibility. Both assumptions are
formally introduced in \cref{sec:preliminaries}. Our main positive result
states that under these assumptions, one can compute an \kl{equivariant Gröbner
basis} of an \kl{equivariant ideal}.

\begin{theorem}[name={Equivariant Gröbner Basis},restate=thm:compute-equiv-gb]
  \label{thm:compute-egb}
  Let $\Indets$ be a totally ordered set of indeterminates
  equipped with a group action $\group \actson \Indets$, that satisfies our \kl{computability assumptions}
  and is \kl{well-structured}.
  Then, one can
  compute a \kl{equivariant Gröbner bases} of \kl{equivariant ideals}.
\end{theorem}

Using standard techniques for polynomial ideals, we then apply our
\cref{thm:compute-egb} to provide an effective representation of
\kl{equivariant ideals} under the same assumptions.

\begin{corollary}[name={},restate=cor:equivariant-ideals-computations]
  \label{cor:equivariant-ideals-computations}
  Assume that $\group \actson \Indets$
  is \kl{effectively oligomorphic}
  and \kl{well-structured}.
  Then one has an \emph{effective representation} of
  the \kl{equivariant ideals} of $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$,
  such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item One can obtain a representation from an orbit-finite set of generators,
    \item One can effectively decide the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem}
      given a representation,
    \item The following operations are computable at the level of representations:
      the union of two \kl{equivariant ideals}, 
      the product of two \kl{equivariant ideals},
      the intersection of two \kl{equivariant ideals},
      and checking whether two \kl{equivariant ideals} are equal.
  \end{enumerate}
  \proofref{cor:equivariant-ideals-computations}
\end{corollary}

\AP We then illustrate how our positive results apply to
numerous situations by providing families of indeterminates that
satisfy our \kl{computability assumptions} and are \kl{well-structured},
and by showing that these are closed
under \kl{disjoint sums} and \kl{lexicographic products}. Furthermore,
we avoid the requirement that a total ordering is present on
the indeterminates by defining \kl{nicely orderable} actions
(\cref{thm:reducts-computable}). Examples of
indeterminates that we can therefore
deal with include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \kl{Equality Atoms}: the indeterminates are an infinite set 
    and $\group$ is all permutations.
  \item \kl{Dense Linear Orders}: the indeterminates are $\Q$,
    and $\group$ is all order-preserving bijections.
  \item \kl{Dense Meet Tree}: the indeterminates are elements of the 
    infinite dense meet tree, and $\group$ is its group of automorphisms.
\end{enumerate}

\AP We then apply our positive results (\cref{thm:compute-egb,cor:equivariant-ideals-computations})
to obtain decision procedures for the following problems,
where $\group \actson \Indets$ is a \kl{nicely orderable} group action:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \cref{cor:orbit-finite-polynomial-automata-zeroness}:
    The \kl(ofpa){zeroness problem} for \kl{orbit finite polynomial automata},
  \item \cref{cor:rev data VAS}:
    The \kl(revdatapn){reachability problem} for \kl{reversible Petri nets with data},
  \item \cref{cor:lin solv}:
    The \kl(ofeq){solvability problem} for \kl{orbit-finite linear systems of equations}.
\end{enumerate}

\AP Finally, we provide undecidability results for the \kl{equivariant ideal
membership problem} in cases where our effective assumptions are satisfied,
but the action is not \kl{well-structured}. This illustrates the fact
that our assumptions are close to optimal. One classical obstruction to a
group action being \kl{well-structured} is the ability to represent an
\emph{infinite path} (a formal definition is given in
\cref{sec:undecidability}). We prove that whenever one can (effectively)
represent an infinite path in the set of monomials $\mon{\Indets}$, the
\kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} is undecidable.

\begin{theorem}[name={Undecidability of Equivariant Ideal Membership},restate=thm:undecidable-paths]
  \label{thm:undecidable-paths}
  Let $\Indets$ be a totally ordered set of indeterminates
  equipped with a group action $\group \actson \Indets$, under our \kl{computability assumptions}.
  If $\Indets$ contains an \kl(of){infinite path}
  then the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} is undecidable.
\end{theorem}
%
As corollaries of our results, we obtain the decidability of the reachability problem for reversible Petri nets with data and the solvability problem for orbit-finite systems of linear equations for data domains that are reducts of totally ordered and well-structured structures (\Cref{sec:applications}).
This class of data domains includes both equality and ordered atoms,
as well as dense tree atoms.

Note that the decidability of the reachability problem for data Petri nets remains open for equality atoms, whilst for ordered atoms this problem is known to be undecidable \cite{RODA11}.
Orbit-finite systems of linear equations were previously known to be solvable only for equality atoms, ordered atoms, and their lexicographic products (\cite{GHOLAS24}).
%
\subsection{Related Research} We call \kl{Equality Atoms} the infinite set
of indeterminates with all permutations acting on them. The fact that
\kl{Hilbert's basis property} holds for polynomials with indeterminates being
\kl{Equality Atoms} is a frequently rediscovered fact
\cite{AH07,AH08,HS12,HKL18}.
Recently, Ghosh and Lasota provided a general answer to characterise which group actions enjoy \kl{Hilbert's basis property}
\cite[Theorem 11 and 12]{GHOLAS24}, and provided, in some limited settings, a
version of \kl{Buchberger's algorithm} \cite[Section 6]{GHOLAS24}.
Let us recall their precise statements in order to compare it with our contributions.

\begin{theorem}[name={\cite[Theorem 11 and 12]{GHOLAS24}}]
  \label{thm:equiv-hilbert-property}
  Let $\Indets$ be a set of indeterminates equipped with a
  group action $\group \actson \Indets$.
  Then,
  \cref{item:equiv-hilb-om-ord} implies 
  \cref{item:equiv-hilb-hbp} implies 
  \cref{item:equiv-hilb-om}, where
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{item:equiv-hilb-om-ord}
      The action is \kl{$\omega$-well-structured} and the indeterminates are equipped with a total order
      \kl(ord){compatible} with the group action,
    \item \label{item:equiv-hilb-hbp}
      The \kl{equivariant Hilbert basis property} holds for  $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$,
    \item \label{item:equiv-hilb-om}
      The action is \kl{$\omega$-well-structured}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

It should be noted that being \kl{$\omega$-well-structured} is \emph{a priori}
a weaker condition than being \kl{well-structured}, although the two
are conjectured to be equivalent \cite[Problems 9]{POUZ24}. Similarly, it is
conjectured that \cref{item:equiv-hilb-om} and \cref{item:equiv-hilb-om-ord}
are equivalent\footnote{Up to modifying the group action to respect the
ordering.} \cite[Problems 12]{POUZ24}. Consequently, our
\cref{thm:compute-egb} is conjectured to hold whenever the \kl{equivariant
Hilbert basis property} does. Note that
\cref{thm:equiv-hilbert-property,thm:compute-egb} are incomparable: the former
does not address decidability, whilst the latter only considers
\kl{equivariant ideals} that are already finitely presented. We show
in \cref{ex:non-wqo-undecidable} an example where \kl{equivariant Gröbner
bases} are computable, but the \kl{equivariant Hilbert basis property} fails.

We now comment on the decision procedures found in the literature.
First, most results focus on \kl{Dense Linear Orders} or \kl{Equality Atoms},
which are merely special cases of our general result. The reason for this is that,
until this paper, the only way to provide a decision procedure was to
assume that the ordering on the indeterminates was \emph{well-founded}
\cite[Section 6]{GHOLAS24}, or to encode the behaviour of the indeterminates in
a set with a \emph{well-founded total ordering} \cite[Section 7, Reduction
Game]{GHOLAS24}. We provide the first result that dispenses with the assumption
that the ordering is \emph{well-founded}. Consequently, we can deal with
the \kl{Dense Linear Order} without employing any encoding tricks. Moreover, with the \kl{Dense Meet Tree}, we provide an example of a group action whose
\kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} was not previously known to be decidable.
Our applications to the decidability of other problems in theoretical
computer science strictly extend those given in \cite[Section 4, 8, and
9]{GHOLAS24}. Indeed, their encoding of \emph{orbit finite weighted automata}
did not require the ability to test inclusion of \kl{equivariant ideals}, whereas
it is central to our result on \kl{orbit finite polynomial automata} (which
strictly generalise weighted automata). Moreover, their solutions to the
problems concerning \kl{reversible Petri-nets with data} and \kl{orbit-finite
linear systems of equations} only apply when the indeterminates are equipped
with a \emph{well-founded} total ordering, which we do not require.

Finally, our results contribute to a larger research direction that aims to
establish an algorithmic theory of computation with orbit-finite sets. For
instance, \cite{BFKM24} studies equivariant subspaces of vector spaces
generated by orbit-finite sets, \cite{GHL22,GHL25} investigate the solvability of
orbit-finite systems of linear equations and inequalities, and
\cite{BFKM24,GHL22,Prz23} study the duals of vector spaces generated by
orbit-finite sets.


\para{Organisation.} \AP The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In
\cref{sec:preliminaries}, we formally introduce the notions of \kl{Gröbner
bases}, \kl{effectively oligomorphic} actions, and \kl{well-quasi-orderings},
which are the main assumptions of our positive results. Subsequently, we
introduce in \cref{sec:weakgb} an adaptation of \kl{Buchberger's algorithm} to
the equivariant case, which computes a \kl{weak equivariant Gröbner basis} of an
\kl{equivariant ideal}. In \cref{sec:equivariant-grobner-basis}, we use
\kl{weak equivariant Gröbner bases} to prove our main result \cref{thm:compute-egb}
and show that it provides a way to effectively represent \kl{equivariant ideals}
(\cref{cor:equivariant-ideals-computations}). We then show in \cref{sec:closure-properties}
that the assumptions of our \cref{thm:compute-egb} are closed under natural operations
(\cref{cor:closure-properties,thm:reducts-computable}). The positive results
regarding the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} are then applied to
obtain several decision procedures. Finally, in \cref{sec:undecidability}, we
show that our assumptions are close to optimal by proving that the
\kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} is undecidable whenever one can find
\kl(of){infinite paths} in the set of indeterminates
(\cref{thm:undecidable-paths}).
This is conjectured to provide a
complete characterisation of the undecidability of the \kl{equivariant ideal
membership problem} (\Cref{conj:wqo-infinite-path}).
