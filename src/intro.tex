\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Hilbert’s bases theorem and Gröbner basis computations
are central tools. But people want to use infinite sets
of indeterminates.

\cite{GHOLAS24}.


\paragraph{Organisation of the paper.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We introduce an abstract formulation of the problem 
        in terms of indeterminates equipped with a group action, and
        provide several examples and non-examples.
    \item We present the algorithmic assumptions and the main decidability
        result.
    \item We prove that mild changes in the algorithmic assumptions
        lead to undecidability.
    \item We conclude by discussing the relationship with existing
        results: in particular we provide examples of relational
        structures and groups that satisfy the algorithmic assumptions.
\end{enumerate}
