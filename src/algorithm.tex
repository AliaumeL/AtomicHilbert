\section{Decision Procedure for the Equivariant Ideal Membership Problem}
\label{sec:algorithm}



\todo[inline]{
  We use the result of the previous section to leverage the computation
  of a weak Gröbner basis to obtain a decision procedure for the
  equivariant ideal membership problem. This is done by 
  computing an $S$-strong Gröbner basis, which is a set of polynomials
  such that.
  This is done by changing the ordering on the indeterminates, 
  and the group action.
}



In this section we provide a decision procedure for the \kl{equivariant ideal
membership problem}. In order to do so, we will adapt the classical Buchberger
algorithm \cite{BUCH76}: to a given set $H$ of polynomials, one can associate a
rewriting system $\to_H$ that computes a ``reduced form'' of a polynomial $p$
with respect to $H$, with the property that if $p$ reduces to zero, then $p$
belongs to $\gen{H}{}$. The Buchberger algorithm starts with a set $H$ and
iteratively adds new polynomials to $H$ without changing the generated ideal,
until the ``reduction procedure'' is complete, that is, until a polynomial
reduces to zero if and only if it belongs to $\gen{H}{}$.

There are two main difficulties in adapting the Buchberger algorithm to the
equivariant setting. First, the set of indeterminates is infinite, which
requires a careful modification of the rewriting system to ensure its
termination. Second, the saturation procedure uses a total well-founded
ordering of the monomials, which is not clearly adaptable to the equivariant
setting.

In \cite{GHOLAS24}, a definition of \kl{equivariant Gröbner basis} is given,
together with an adaptation of the Buchberger algorithm to the equivariant
setting under the extra assumption that the set of indeterminates is equipped
with a \kl{well-founded} total ordering that is \kl{respected by the group
action}. In particular, this result does not apply to the case of
indeterminates $(\Q, \leq)$ together with all the order preserving
automorphisms of $\Q$.
To keep the presentation simple, we will use the following definition
of \kl{equivariant Gröbner basis}, that essentially
reduces an \kl{equivariant membership problem} to a classical
\kl{ideal membership problem}.
An \intro{equivariant Gröbner basis} 
is a finite set $\Basis$
satisfying:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:grob-eq-bas}
    \forall S \subfin \X, 
    \forall p \in \poly{\K}{S},
    p \in \gen{\Basis}{\group}
    \iff
    p \in \gen{\Basis \cap \poly{\K}{S}}
        \quad .
\end{equation}

In particular, once we have an \kl{equivariant Gröbner basis} $\Basis$, the
\kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} is decidable: given a polynomial $p$,
we can check whether $p$ belongs to $\gen{\Basis \cap \poly{\K}{S}}{}$ where
$S$ is the set of indeterminates appearing in $p$, which is possible using
classical tools for Gröbner basis computations such as the Buchberger algorithm
\cite{BUCH76}. In fact, our construction will be such that $\Basis \cap
\poly{\K}{S}$ is already a (classical) Gröbner basis for the ideal $\gen{\Basis
\cap \poly{\K}{S}}{}$, which means that the computation of the classical
membership query is relatively straightforward.

The key idea of this section is to swap quantifiers in \cref{eq:grob-eq-bas}
to obtain a weaker notion of Gröbner basis that is somehow
\emph{local}.  Instead of computing a Gröbner basis that works
``for all $S$'', we will compute, given $S$, a
Gröbner basis that works ``for this $S$'', as formalised hereafter.
\begin{definition}
    \label{def:weak-grob}
    Let $S \subfin \X$ be a finite set of indeterminates.
    A set $\Basis \subseteq \poly{\K}{\X}$ is an \intro{$S$-local Gröbner basis}
    if it satisfies the following property:
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:weak-grob}
        \forall p \in \poly{\K}{S},
        p \in \gen{\Basis}{\group}
        \iff
        p \in \gen{\Basis \cap \poly{\K}{S}}
        \quad .
    \end{equation}
    A \reintro{local Gröbner basis} 
    is a set $\Basis$ that is an $S$-local Gröbner basis
    for some finite set $S \subfin \X$.
\end{definition}

The following lemma states that computing \kl{local Gröbner bases} is enough to
decide the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem}. It is not known whether
one can use the computability of \kl{local Gröbner bases} to compute an
\kl{equivariant Gröbner basis}, even in simple cases.

\begin{lemma}
    Assume that for all finite set $S$ and 
    finitely presented \kl{equivariant ideal} $I$,
    one can compute an 
    \kl{$S$-local Gröbner basis} $\Basis$ of $I$.
    Then, the
    \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem}
    is decidable.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $p \in \poly{\K}{S}$, 
    and $\Basis$ be an \kl{$S$-local Gröbner basis}.
    To decide whether $p \in \gen{\Basis}{\group}$,
    it suffices to compute $\Basis \cap \poly{\K}{S}$
    and check whether 
    $p \in \gen{\Basis \cap \poly{\K}{S}}{}$, which is possible
    because $S$ is a finite set and one can therefore use 
    the classical ideal membership decision procedure.
\end{proof}

In order to compute an \kl{$S$-local Gröbner basis}, for a given finite set $S$
of indeterminates, we will reduce the problem to the computation of a similar
object, but on a smaller set of allowed automorphisms: we will only consider
those elements $g \in \group$ that fix all indeterminates in $S$, i.e. such
that $g \cdot x = x$ for all $x \in S$. We write $\group_S$ for the subgroup of
$\group$ that fixes all indeterminates in $S$.

We say that
an \intro{$S$-supported Gröbner basis} is a set $\Basis_S$
satisfying:
\begin{equation*}
    \label{eq:supp-grob}
    \forall p \in \poly{\K}{S},
    p \in \gen{\Basis_S}{\group_S}
    \iff
    p \in \gen{\Basis_S \cap \poly{\K}{S}}{}
\end{equation*}

Let us immediately prove that being able to compute \kl{$S$-supported Gröbner
bases} is sufficient to compute \kl{$S$-local Gröbner bases}, hence to
answer the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem}.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:local-to-supported}
  Let $S$ be a finite set of indeterminates.
  Assume that one can compute an \kl{$S$-supported Gröbner basis}
  of $\gen{H}{\group_S}$ for any finite set $H$ of polynomials.
  Then, 
  one can compute an \kl{$S$-local Gröbner basis}
  for any finite set $H$ 
  of polynomials.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $H$ be a finite set of polynomials.
  We will compute a new finite set $H_S$ of polynomials
  such that $\gen{H}{\group} = \gen{H_S}{\group_S}$.
  To do so, we will use the fact that $\X$ is \kl{effectively oligomorphic}:
  for every polynomial $p \in H$, we can compute a finite set
  $p_S$ of representatives of the \kl{$\group_S$-orbits} of $p$.
  We define $H_S$ to be the union of all the $p_S$ for $p \in H$.

  It is clear that $\gen{H_S}{\group_S} \subseteq \gen{H}{\group}$.
  Conversely, let $p \in \gen{H}{\group}$, then $p$ is in the \kl{$\group$-orbit}
  of some $p' \in H$. By definition, there exists a $\pi \in \group$ such that
  $p = \pi(p')$. We can compute a representative $p_S$ of the
  \kl{$\group_S$-orbit} of $p'$, and we can compute a $\pi_S \in \group_S$
  such that $\pi_S(p_S) = p$. We conclude that $p$ is in the \kl{$\group_S$-orbit}
  of $p_S$, hence $p \in \gen{H_S}{\group_S}$.
  Hence, $\gen{H}{\group} = \gen{H_S}{\group_S}$.

  Let us now compute an \kl{$S$-supported Gröbner basis} of $\gen{H_S}{\group_S}$,
  $\Basis_S$.  
  Remark that
  $\gen{\Basis_S}{\group} = \gen{\gen{\Basis_S}{\group_S}}{\group}
                           = \gen{H}{\group} 
                           = \gen{\Basis_S}{\group_S}$.
  Hence,
  $
    \gen{\Basis_S}{\group} \cap \poly{\K}{S} 
        = \gen{\Basis_S}{\group_S} \cap \poly{\K}{S}  
        = \gen{\Basis_S \cap \poly{\K}{S}}{} 
        $.
  And we have proven that $\Basis_S$ is an \kl{$S$-local Gröbner basis}
  for $\gen{H}{\group}$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Preliminaries on $S$-supported Bases}
\label{subsec:weakgb}

In this subsection, we fix $S \subfin \X$, and will work only with the group
$\group_S$ that fixes all indeterminates in $S$. We furthermore assume that
$\X$ is equipped with an (effective) linear order $\order$ that is
\kl{respected by the group action}. The main technical content of this
subsection consists in the understanding of the action of $\group_S$ on
$\poly{\K}{S}$.

\AP Let us recall that for any \kl{group action} $\group \actson \X$ yields a
notion of \kl{divisibility up-to $\group$} that we write $p \gdivleq[\group]
q$. As $\group_S$ is a subgroup of $\group$, the action of $\group$ on $\X$
induces an action of $\group_S$ on $S$, and therefore a notion of divisibility
up-to $\group_S$ that we write $p \gdivleq[\group_S] q$. Remark that a
necessary condition for the existence of \kl{$S$-supported Gröbner bases} is
that the \kl{divisibility up-to $\group_S$} is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering} on
$\mon{S}$. This follows the usual pattern (see \cite{GHOLAS24}). 

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:wqo-needed-g-s}
    Assume that every \kl{equivariant ideal} $I$
    for $\group_S$ in $\poly{\K}{\X}$
    has an \kl{$S$-supported Gröbner basis}.
    Then, the \kl{divisibility up-to $\group_S$} is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
    Assume that there exists an infinite bad sequence 
    $\seqof{m_i}[i \in \N]$ for the \kl{divisibility up-to $\group_S$}.
    Then, let us write $I_i \defined \gen{\setof{m_j}{j \leq i}}{\group_S}$
    for $i \in \N$. By assumption, there exists a \kl{$S$-supported Gröbner basis}
    $\Basis$ of $\bigcup_{i \in \N} I_i$. This means that
    the union stabilises, that is, there exists $N \in \N$ such that
    $I_i = I_N$ for all $i \geq N$. 
    In particular, $m_i \in I_N$ for all $i \geq N$.
    We conclude that $m_{N+1} = \sum_{j \leq N} q_j \pi_j(m_j)$ for some 
    $q_j \in \poly{\K}{\X}$,
    $\pi_j \in \group_S$, and $m_j \in \setof{m_j}{j \leq N}$.
    But this immediately shows that $m_{N+1}$ is \kl{divisible up-to
    $\group_S$} by some $m_j$ for $j \leq N$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

In order to derive the fact that \kl{divisibility up-to $\group_S$} is a
\kl{well-quasi-ordering}, we enforce that the $\mon[\omega+1]{\X}$ is a
\kl{well-quasi-ordering} with respect to the \kl{divisibility up-to $\group$}.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{def:wqo-g-implies-g-s}
    Assume that $\mon[\omega+1]{\X}$ is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering} with respect to
    the \kl{divisibility up-to $\group$}. Then, the \kl{divisibility up-to
    $\group_S$} is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

    Let $\seqof{m_i}[i \in \N]$ be an infinite sequence of \kl{monomials}. Let
    us write $s_i$ to be the \kl{monomial} obtained by restricting $m_i$ to the
    set of indeterminates in $S$, an $r_i$ be such that $m_i = s_i r_i$. We can
    build $s'$ to be the monomial $\prod_{x \in S} x^{\omega+1}$, which belongs
    to $\mon[\omega+1]{\X}$. Using this monomial, one can build a new sequence
    $\seqof{m_i'}[i \in \N]$ of monomials, defined by $m_i' \defined s' r_i$.

    Because $\mon[\omega+1]{\X}$ is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering} for the
    \kl{divisibility up-to $\group$}, one can assume without loss of generality
    that for all $i < j$, there exists an element $\pi_{i,j} \in \group$ and
    $q_{i,j} \in \mon[\omega+1]{\X}$ such that $q_{i,j} \pi_{i,j}(m_i') =
    m_j'$. Let us first remark that $q_{i,j}$ belongs to $\mon{\X}$, i.e., does
    not use the exponent $\omega+1$. Furthermore, we claim that for all $i <
    j$, $\pi_{i,j}(S) = S$. Indeed, indeterminates of $S$ are exactly the ones
    with exponent $\omega+1$ in the monomials $m_i'$ for all $i \in \N$.

    Using a Ramsey argument, one can assume that $\pi_{i,j}$ acts as the
    identity over $S$. In particular, $\pi_{i,j} \in \group_S$ for all $i < j$.
    Because $\N^{|S|}$ is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering} for the pointwise
    comparison relation, one can also assume that for all $i < j$, $s_i \divleq
    s_j$. In particular, one obtains monomials $p_{i,j} \in \mon{S}$ such that
    $s_i p_{i,j} = s_j$.

    Finally, we have 
    \begin{align*}
        m_j'      &= q_{i,j} \cdot \pi_{i,j}(m_i')
                  = q_{i,j} \cdot \pi_{i,j}(s' r_i) \\
        s' r_j    &= q_{i,j} s' \cdot \pi_{i,j}(r_i) \\
        r_j    &= q_{i,j} \cdot \pi_{i,j}(r_i) \\
        s_j r_j    &= s_j q_{i,j} \cdot \pi_{i,j}(r_i) \\
        m_j    &= p_{i,j} q_{i,j} s_i \cdot \pi_{i,j}(r_i) \\
        m_j    &= p_{i,j} q_{i,j} \cdot \pi_{i,j}(s_i r_i) \\
        m_j    &= p_{i,j} q_{i,j} \cdot \pi_{i,j}(m_i) 
    \end{align*}
    Hence, $m_i \gdivleq[\group_S] m_j$ for all $i < j$, which concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

\AP
Provided that one has a total ordering $\order$ on $\X$ that is 
\kl{respected by the group action} (of $\group$), we can adapt $\order$
by conserving the same relative ordering for elements that are in $S$
(resp. not in $S$) but placing all elements of $S$ \emph{below} all
elements not in $S$:
\begin{equation}
    x \sOrderLt y \iff 
    \begin{cases}
        x \order y & \text{if } x,y \in S \lor x,y \not\in S  \\
        \top       & \text{if } x \in S \land y \not \in S \\
        \bot       & \text{if } x \not\in S \land y \in S \\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:total-ordering}
    The ordering $\sOrderLt$ is a total ordering on $\X$,
    that is \kl{respected by} $\group_S$,
    and is \kl(order){effective} whenever $\order$ is.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Because $\order$ is a \kl{total ordering}, 
    so is $\sOrderLt$. 
    Assume that $x \sOrderLt y$, and let $\pi \in \group_S$.
    If $x,y \in S$, then $\pi(x) = x$ and $\pi(y) = y$, hence
    $\pi(x) \sOrderLt \pi(y)$, the same happens if
    both elements are not in $S$. The last case is when
    $x \in S$ and $y \not \in S$, in which case $\pi(x) = x$
    and $\pi(y) \not \in S$ (because $\pi$ is a bijection that \kl{fixes} $S$).

    Finally,
    assuming that one can test equality of elements in $\X$ and that
    $\order$ is \kl{effective}, it is clear that $\sOrderLt$ is \kl{effective}
    too.
\end{proof}

\AP The construction of $\sOrderLeq$ is such that its corresponding
\kl{monomial ordering} $\revlex[S]$ ensures that whenever the \kl{leading
monomial} of a polynomial $p$ belongs to $\mon{S}$, then $p$ belongs to
$\poly{\K}{S}$ (\cref{lem:g-s-lm-in-S}), and that the action of $\group_S$ on
$\poly{\K}{S}$ preserves \kl{leading monomials}, \kl{leading coefficients},
\kl{leading terms}, and \kl{characteristic monomials}
(\cref{lem:g-s-acts-preserves-lead}).
%
\begin{definition}\label{def:LM T}
\arka{TODO : Define $\lm[T]$, $\var(f)$ and other related stuff}
\end{definition}
%
\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:g-s-acts-preserves-lead}
    Let $\pi \in \group_S$ and $p \in \poly{\K}{\X}$.
    Then, $\lm[S](\pi(p)) = \pi(\lm[S](p))$,
    and similarly for $\cm[S]$, $\lt[S]$, and $\lc[S]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    This follows from the fact that for every pair of monomials
    $m,m' \in \mon{\X}$,
    $m \revlex[S] m'$ if and only if $\pi(m) \revlex[S] \pi(m')$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:g-s-lm-in-S}
    Let $p \in \poly{\K}{\X}$,
    be such that $\lm[S](p) \in \mon{S}$.
    Then, $p \in \poly{\K}{S}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We prove that if $m \revlex[S] m'$ and $m' \in \mon{S}$, then $m \in
    \mon{S}$. Let us order the indeterminates appearing in $m$ and $m'$ $x_1
    \sOrderLt x_2 \sOrderLt \cdots \sOrderLt x_n$. Let us write $m = \prod_{1
    \leq i \leq n} x_i^{\ell_i}$ and $m' = \prod_{1 \leq i \leq n} x_i^{k_i}$.
    Because $m \revlex[S] m'$, there exists $i$ such that $k_i < \ell_i$ and
    $k_j = \ell_j$ for all $i < j$. In particular, $k_i \neq 0$, hence $x_i \in
    S$. As a consequence, $x_j \in S$ for all $j \leq i$ by definition of
    $\sOrderLt$. Assume by contraction that $x_j \not\in S$ for some $j > i$,
    then $k_j = l_j$, but since $x_j \not\in S$, we have $k_j = 0$, hence $l_j
    = 0$, which is absurd because $x_j$ appears in $m$ or $m'$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:g-s-gb-is-gb}
    Let $\Basis$ be a finite set such that,
    for every $p \in \gen{\Basis}{\group_S}$,
    there exists $q \in \Basis$
    satisfying $\lm[S](q) \gdivleq[\group_S] \lm[S](q)$.
    Then, $\Basis$ is an \kl{$S$-supported Gröbner basis}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $p \in \poly{\K}{S} \cap \gen{\Basis}{\group_S}$.
    Let us remark that $\lm[S](p) \in \mon{S}$,
    and that $\revlex[S]$ is \kl{well-founded} on $\mon{S}$,
    since $S$ is finite. Assume by contradiction that 
    $p \not \in \gen{\Basis \cap \poly{\K}{S}}{}$,
    and that $p$ is a counter-example with a $\revlex[S]$ minimal
    \kl{leading monomial}.

    By construction, there exists $q \in \Basis$ such that $\lm[S](q)
    \gdivleq[\group_S] \lm[S](p)$. This provides a $\pi \in \group_S$ and an $r
    \in \mon{\X}$ such that $\pi(\lm[S](q)) \cdot r = \lm[S](p)$.
    Because $\lm[S](p) \in \mon{S}$, we conclude 
    that $\pi(\lm[S](q)) \in \mon{S}$ and $r \in \mon{S}$.
    Since, $\pi$ \kl{fixes} $S$, we conclude that $\lm[S](q) \in \mon{S}$,
    hence $q \in \poly{\K}{S}$ by \cref{lem:g-s-lm-in-S}.
    Finally, 
    $(p - r \cdot q) \in \gen{\Basis}{\group_S}$,
    has a \kl{leading monomial} that is strictly smaller than $\lm[S](p)$,
    and belongs to $\poly{\K}{S}$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Computing $S$-supported Gröbner Bases}
\label{subsec:weakgbcomp}

\AP In this subsection, we prove that one can compute given a finite set $H$ of
polynomials, a finite set $\Basis_S$ that has the following property: for every
$p \in \gen{H}{\group_S}$, there exists $q \in \Basis_S$ such that $\lm[S](q)
\gdivleq[\group_S] \lm[S](p)$. This will prove the (effective) existence of an
\kl{$S$-supported Gröbner basis} thanks to \cref{lem:g-s-gb-is-gb}.

\AP The algorithm is a variation of the Buchberger algorithm \cite{BUCH76},
which we will briefly comment on. First, any finite set $H$ of polynomials
can be used to define a rewriting relation $\reducstep{H}$, and its
reflexive transitive closure $\reduc{H}$.
Namely, we write $p \reducstep{H} q$
if there exists $\pi \in \group_S$, $r \in H$ and $s \in \poly{\K}{\X}$
such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $q = p - s \cdot \pi(r)$,
    \item $\dom(\pi(r)) \subseteq \dom(p)$,
    \item $\lt[S](\pi(r)) = s \cdot \lt[S](p)$.
\end{itemize}
That is, we can use an element of $\Basis$ (up to $\group_S$),
to cancel the \kl{leading monomial}
of a polynomial $p$, without the introduction of new indeterminates.
We write $p \reduc{\Basis} q$ if there exists a
sequence $p = p_0 \reducstep{\Basis} p_1 \reducstep{\Basis} \cdots
\reducstep{\Basis} p_n = q$. 

The inability to introduce new indeterminates is crucial
to ensure that this rewriting system is terminating.
\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:finite-remainders}
    Let $p \in \poly{\K}{\X}$,
    the set of polynomials $q$ such that $p \reduc{\Basis} q$
    is finite.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let us first prove that there are no infinite rewriting sequences.
    To that end, let $\seqof{p_i}[i \in \N]$ be a sequence of 
    polynomial such that $p_i \reducstep{\Basis} p_{i+1}$
    for all $i \in \N$.
    Remark that $\lm[S](p_i)$ is a strictly decreasing 
    sequence of \kl{monomials} in $\mon{\dom(p_0)}$
    for $\revlex[S]$. Because $\dom(p_0)$ is finite,
    this is absurd.

    Let us now prove that there are finitely many 
    possible \kl{rewrite steps} for a given polynomial $p$.
    Indeed, such a step $p \reducstep{\Basis} q$ is
    uniquely determined by a polynomial $r \in \Basis$
    and a bijection $\pi \in \group_S$ such that
    $\dom(\pi(r)) \subseteq \dom(p)$. Because $\Basis$ is finite,
    and $\dom(p)$ is finite, there are only finitely many such $\pi(r)$
    to choose from.

    We conclude thanks to König's lemma that there are only finitely
    many polynomials $q$ such that $p \reduc{\Basis} q$.
\end{proof}

\AP As a consequence of \cref{lem:finite-remainders}, starting polynomial $p$,
we can compute the (finite) set of all \kl{reduced polynomials} that can be obtained
from $p$ by rewriting with $\Basis$, that we write $\rem{\Basis}{p}$. 

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:rewrite-equivariant}
    Let $p,q \in \poly{\K}{\X}$, and $\pi \in \group_S$.
    Then,
    $p \reducstep{\Basis} q$ if and only if
    $\pi(p) \reducstep{\Basis} \pi(q)$.
    In particular, $\pi(\rem{\Basis}{p}) = \rem{\Basis}{\pi(p)}$,
    i.e., the set of remainders is \kl{equivariant}
    under the action of $\group_S$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \todo[inline]{do it}
\end{proof}


\AP Let $p,q$ be two polynomials in $\poly{\K}{\X}$. Then we write $[p;q]$ for
the collection of \kl{polynomials} $\delta = a \mon p + b \mon q$ such that
$\lm[S](\delta) < \max(\lm[S](p), \lm[S](q))$. These are the potential
cancellations of leading monomials.
The core of the Buchberger algorithm is the fact that
local completeness is enough to ensure global completeness.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:weak-complete-impl-strong}
  Assume that $H$ is a finite set of polynomials
  such that for every $p, q \in H$, and $\delta \in [p;q]$,
  $\delta \reduc{H} 0$.
  Then, for every $p \in \gen{H}{\group_S}$,
  $p \reduc{H} 0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Assume towards a contradiction that $p \in \gen{H}{\group_S}$
  and that $p \not\reduc{H} 0$.
  We can consider a minimal
\end{proof}

\AP It is clear that every element $p$ such that $0 \in \rem{\Basis}{p}$
belongs to $\gen{\Basis}{\group_S}$. The Buchberger algorithm extends $\Basis$
so that the converse holds, that is, every element in $\gen{\Basis}{\group_S}$
has $0$ in its set of remainders. The saturation step consists in adding to
$\Basis$ all the \intro{$\mathsf{D}$-polynomials} 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:d-polynomial}
    \spoly{p}{q} \defined
    \frac{\lcm(\lm[S](p), \lm[S](q))}{\lm[S](p)} \cdot p
    - \frac{\lcm(\lm[S](p), \lm[S](q))}{\lm[S](q)} \cdot q
    \quad .
\end{equation}

These polynomials clearly belong to $\gen{\Basis}{\group_S}$.
Given a set $H$, we write $\spolyset(H) \defined \bigcup_{p,q \in H}
\rem{\Basis}{\spoly{p}{q}}$.
