\section{Computing the Equivariant Gröbner Basis}
\label{sec:equivariant-grobner-basis}

Let us now leverage the decidability of the ideal membership problem to compute
the equivariant Gröbner basis of an equivariant ideal. Let us recall that a
Gröbner basis is known to exist, but that it's computability was an open
question of \cite{GHOLAS24}.
