\section{Relation to Existing Results and Examples}
\label{sec:examples}
%In this section, we are interested in the consequences of our decidability
%results. First, we will provide numerous examples of sets of indeterminates
%that satisfy our \kl{computability assumptions} as well as our
%\kl{well-quasi-ordering} conditions. Then, we will discuss how our results can
%be applied to solve various decidability problems in theoretical computer
%science.
%
%\todo[inline]{for arka: integrate these examples}
%\begin{example}
%  \label{ex:q-is-super-wqo}
%  The set $(\mon[Y]{\Indets_\calQ}, \gdivleq)$ is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering} whenever $Y$ is
%  one, and in particular $\Indets_\calQ$ satisfies the computability assumptions and
%  the termination assumptions of both \cref{thm:compute-egb}
%  and
%  \cref{thm:decide-equiv-ideal-mem}.
%\end{example}
%\begin{proof}
%  Let $\seqof{\monelt_i}[i \in \N]$ be a sequence of monomials in
%  $\mon[Y]{\Indets_\calQ}$. Let us write each monomial $\monelt_i$ as
%  a finite word $w_i$ over the alphabet $Y$, by writing all the exponents in the order 
%  prescribed by the indeterminates.
%  Because $Y$ is a \kl{well-quasi-ordering}, the set of all finite words over $Y$ is
%  \kl{well-quasi-ordered} by the \emph{scattered subword} relation \cite{HIG52}.
%  Now, if $w_i$ is a scattered subword of $w_j$, then
%  $\monelt_i \gdivleq \monelt_j$, by choosing a suitable $\gelem \in \group$.
%\end{proof}
%
%\begin{example}
%  \label{ex:z-is-not-wqo}
%  The set $(\mon[Y]{\Indets_\Z}, \gdivleq)$ is not a \kl{well-quasi-ordering} whenever $Y$ is
%  contains two distinct elements.
%  In particular, $\Indets_\Z$ does not satisfy the termination assumptions of
%  \cref{thm:compute-egb} and \cref{thm:decide-equiv-ideal-mem}.
%\end{example}
%\begin{proof}
%  Assume that $Y$ has two distinct elements $a$ and $b$, and let us assume without loss of generality
%  that $a \leq b$. The sequence of monomials 
%  $\monelt_i \defined x_1^{b} x_2^{a} \cdots x_{i-1}^{a} x_i^{b}$
%  forms an infinite antichain in $(\mon[Y]{\Indets_\Z}, \gdivleq)$.
%  Indeed, if $\monelt_i \gdivleq \monelt_j$ for some $i < j$, then
%  without loss of generality, $\gelem_i (x_1) = x_1$, and 
%  $\gelem_i (x_i) = x_j$, because these are the only ones that can be 
%  equipped with a large enough exponent.
%  Therefore, $\gelem_i = \mathrm{id}$ since the group only contains translations.
%  However, this implies that the exponent of $x_j$ in $\monelt_j$ is at most $a$,
%  which contradicts the fact that it is $b$.
%\end{proof}

\subsection{Crafting sets of indeterminates}
%
Many of the common examples of group actions $\group\actson\Indets$ are of the form where $\Indets$ is a set with some structure, described by some relations and functions on that set,
and $\group$ is the group $\aut{\Indets}$ of all automorphisms (i.e.\ bijections that preserve and reflect the structure) of $\Indets$.
A monomial $\monelt[p] \in \mon[Q]{\Indets}$ can be thought as a labelling of a finite substructure of $\X$ using elements of $Y$.
If the structure $\Indets$ is \intro{homogenous} :
isomorphism between finite induced substructures extends to an automorphism of the whole structure,
then $\gdivleq$ is same as embedding of labelled finite induced substructures of $\X$.
\footnote{
We refer the reader to \cite[Chapter 7]{BOJAN16inf} and \cite{homsurvey} for more details on homogeneous structures.}
We give some examples of homogeneous structures and discuss whether they satisfy the WQO condition of \Cref{thm:compute-egb} :
$(\mon[Y]{\Indets},\gdivleq[\aut{\Indets}])$ is a \kl{WQO} for every \kl{WQO} $Y$. 
%
\begin{example}\label{ex:eq atoms}
Let $\A$ be an infinite set without any additional structure other than the equality relation.
%Then $\aut{\A}$ is the set of all bijections of the set $\A$.
Up to isomorphism, finite induced substructures of $\A$ are finite sets,
monomials in $\mon[Y]{\A}$ are finite multisets of elements in $Y$,
and $\gdivleq[\aut{\A}]$ is the multiset ordering \cite[Section 1.5]{SCSC17},
which is a \kl{WQO} \cite[Corollary 1.21]{SCSC17}.
\end{example}
%
\begin{example}\label{ex:dlo}
Let $\calQ$ be the set of rational numbers ordered by the usual ordering.
Note that under this ordering, $\calQ$ is a dense linear order without endpoints.
We write $\calQ$ instead of $\Q$ to emphasise that we use its elements as indeterminates and not as coefficients of polynomials. 
Up to isomorphism, finite induced substructures of $\calQ$ are finite linear orders,
monomials in $\mon[Y]{\calQ}$ are words in $Y^*$ (i.e.\ finite linear order labelled with elements of $Y$)
and $\gdivleq[\aut{\calQ}]$ is the scattered subword ordering, which is a \kl{WQO} due to Higman's lemma \cite{HIG52}.
\end{example}
%
\begin{example}\label{ex:rado}
Let $\G$ be the Rado graph (\cite[Section 7.3.1]{BOJAN16inf},\cite[Example 2.2.1]{homsurvey}).
Up to isomorphism,
finite induced substructures of $\G$ are finite undirected graphs,
monomials in $\mon[Y]{\G}$ are graphs with vertices labelled with $Y$,
and $\gdivleq[\aut{\G}]$ is the labelled induced subgraph ordering even when $Y$ is a singleton.
For example, cycles of length more than three form an infinite antichain.
\end{example}
%
\begin{example}\label{ex:bit vector}
Let $\V$ be an infinite dimensional vector space over $\ftwo$.
Up to isomorphism,
finite induced substructures of $\V$ are finite dimensional vector spaces over $\ftwo$.
These are well-quasi-ordered in the absence of labelling.
However, even when $Y = \N$,
$(\mon[Y]{\V},\gdivleq[\aut{\V}])$ is not a \kl{WQO} as illustrated by the following antichain.
Let $\{v_1,v_2,\dots\}\subseteq \V$ be a countable set of linearly independent vectors in $\V$.
Let $\oplus$ denote the addition operation of $\V$.
For $n \geq 3$ define the monomial $\monelt[p]_n$ as 
\[
\monelt[p]_n = v^2_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot v^2_n \cdot (v_1\oplus v_2) \cdot (v_2\oplus v_3) \ldots \cdot (v_{n-1}\oplus v_n) \cdot (v_{n}\oplus v_1)
\]
Then $\setof{\monelt[p]_n}{n = 3,4,\dots}$ forms an infinite antichain.
\end{example}
%
\begin{example}\label{ex:dense tree}
Let $\T$ denote the universal countable dense meet-tree
\cite[Page 2]{KRS21}\cite[Section 7.3.3]{BOJAN16inf}.
Note that the tree structure is given by the \intro{meet} operation (and not by edges),
which takes as input a pair of nodes of $\T$ and returns their closest common ancestor.
For a subset $S\subset \T$,
define its \intro{closure} to be the smallest subset of $\T$ that is closed under the \kl{meet} operation.
Note that the \kl{closure} of a finite subset is finite. 
Up to isomorphism, finite induced substructures of $\calQ$ are finite meet-trees.
monomials in $\mon[Y]{\calQ}$ are finite meet-trees labelled with $1 + Y$.
Here $1 + Y$ is the \kl{WQO} containing one more element than $Y$ which is incomparable to elements in $Y$,
and is used to label nodes that are in the \kl{closure} of the set of variable of a monomial, but not in the monomial itself.
The relation $\gdivleq[\aut{\T}]$ is the embedding of labelled meet-trees,
which is a \kl{WQO} due to Kruskal's tree theorem \cite{Kruskal60}.
\end{example}
%
We discuss an interesting non-homogeneous structure.
%
\begin{example}\label{ex:int}
Let $\calZ$ be the set of integers ordered by the usual ordering.
Then $\aut{\calZ}$ is the set of all order preserving bijections of $\D$.
Note that every order preserving bijection of the set $\calZ$ is a translation $n \mapsto n + c$ for some constant $c\in\calZ$.
By definition, the action $\aut{\calZ} \actson \calZ$ preserves the linear order on $\Z$.
However, $(\mon[Y]{\calZ}, \gdivleq[\aut{\calZ}])$ is not a \kl{WQO} even when $Y$ is a singleton.
An example of an infinite antichain is the set $\setof{a b}{b\in\calZ\setminus\{a\}}$, for any fixed $a\in\calZ$.
\end{example}
%
\todo[inline]{arka: create a new subsection: stability of our hypotheses, and place 
  it after the section on effective oligomorphisms. Because right now you do not prove
  that these constructions can be used to apply our results.
  Also, a table would be nice. This way, we can separate definitions/examples
  and the actual \emph{results} (that were all already proven somewhere else)
  in a simple table}

For the remainder of this section fix a pair of group actions
$\G\actson\X$ and $\calH\actson\Y$
%
\begin{example}\label{ex:union}
The group actions $\G\actson\X$ and $\calH\actson\Y$ can be extended to a group action $(\G\times\calH)\actson(\X\uplus\Y)$ by defining
\[
(\pi,\sigma)(z) =
\begin{cases}
\pi(z) & \text{if }z\in\X,\\
\sigma(z) & \text{if }z\in \Y.
\end{cases}
\]
\todo[inline]{what is the new linear ordering on the union?}
If the actions $\G\actson\X$ and $\calH\actson\Y$ preserve linear orders then so does the actions $(\G\times\calH)\actson(\X\uplus\Y)$.
Fix a \kl{WQO} $Q$.
We have
\[
(\mon[Q]{\X\uplus\Y}, \gdivleq[\G\times\calH])
\cong
(\mon[Q]{\X}\times\mon[Y]{\Y}, \gdivleq[\G]\times\gdivleq[\calH])
\]
where $\gdivleq[\G]\times\gdivleq[\calH]$ is the product of the orders $\gdivleq[\G]$ and $\gdivleq[\calH]$ defined as
\[
(x,y) \gdivleq[\G]\times\gdivleq[\calH] (x',y')
\quad
\text{if}
\quad
x \gdivleq[\G] x' \text{ and } y \gdivleq[\calH] y' \ .
\]
This implies if $(\mon[Q]{\X},\gdivleq{\G}$ and $(\mon[Q]{\Y},\gdivleq{\calH}$ are \kl{WQOs},
so is $(\mon[Q]{\X\uplus\Y}, \gdivleq[\G\times\calH])$ \cite[Lemma 1.5]{SCSC17}.
\end{example}
%
\begin{example}[\protect{\textnormal{\cite[Example 10]{GHOLAS24}}}]\label{ex:product}
We extend the group actions $\G\actson\X$ and $\calH\actson\Y$ to a group action $(\G \times \calH)\actson(\X\times\Y)$, as 
\[
(\pi,\sigma)((x,y)) = (\pi(x),\sigma(y)) \ .
\]
This group action corresponds to taking products of structures (\arka{citation}).
$(\mon[Q]{\X\times\Y}, \gdivleq[\G \times \calH])$ is not a \kl{WQO} even when $Q$ is a singleton.
For every element $q\in Q$ and two infinite sets $\{x_1,x_2,\dots\}\subseteq\X$ and $\{y_1,y_2,\dots\}\subseteq\Y$,
the set
\[
\setof{(x_1,y_1)^q(x_1,y_2)^q(x_2,y_2)\dots(x_{n-1},y_n)^q(x_n,y_n)^q(x_n,y_0)^q}{
n = 3,4,5,\dots} \subseteq \mon[Q]{\X\times\Y}
\]
is an infinite antichain.
\end{example}
%
The above example shows that products of structures do not preserve our \kl{WQO} property.
Now we show that the lexicographic product of structures
(\cite[Section 2]{GHOLAS24}) preserve this property.
\arka{any other citation?}
%
\begin{example}\label{ex:nested product}
Let $\G\otimes\calH$ be the group whose elements are of the form $(\pi,(\sigma^{x})_{x\in\X})$, where $\sigma_{x}\in\calH$ for every $x\in\X$.
Multiplication is defined as
\[
(\pi_1,(\sigma^{x}_1)_{x\in\X})\cdot(\pi_2,(\sigma^{x}_2)_{x\in\X})
=
(\pi_1\cdot\pi_2, (\sigma_1^{\pi_2(x)}\cdot\sigma_2^x)_{x\in\X}) \ .
\]
The action $\G\otimes\calH \actson \X\times\Y$ is given as
\[
(\pi,(\sigma^{x})_{x\in\X})(x',y') =
(\pi(x'),\sigma^{x'}(y'))\ , \text{ for }(x',y')\in\X\times\Y \ .
\]
Essentially,
each element $x\in\X$ carries its own copy $\{x\}\times\Y$ of the structure $\Y$,
and different copies of the structure $\Y$ can be permuted independently.
If $\G\actson\X$ and $\calH\actson\Y$ preserves the linear orders $<_{\X}$ and $<_{\Y}$, respectively,
then $\G\otimes\calH \actson \X\times\Y$ preserves the lexicographic linear order on $\X\times\Y$ defined as
\[
(x,y) <_{\ell ex} (x',y')\quad\text{if}\quad
\text{$x <_{\X} x'$, or $x = x'$ and $y <_{\Y} y'$.}
\]
Moreover, for every \kl{WQO} $Q$,
if $(\mon[Q]{\X},\gdivleq{\G})$ and $(\mon[Q]{\Y},\gdivleq{\calH})$ are \kl{WQOs},
so is $(\mon[Q]{\X\uplus\Y}, \gdivleq[\G\otimes\calH])$ \cite[Lemma 9]{GHOLAS24}.

%\paragraph{Sets with atoms.}
%
%
%\todo[inline]{Say that if one starts with atoms and equality, then we can only 
%  have dimension 1, and that this is the case of the rationals.}
%
%\paragraph{Relational structures.} Let $\mathbb{A}$ be an infinite relational
%structure with finitely many relations. Then, one can consider the set of
%polynomials $\poly{\K}{\mathbb{A}}$, where indeterminates are elements of the
%universe of $\mathbb{A}$. The group of all automorphisms of $\mathbb{A}$ (i.e.,
%bijections of the universe that preserve the relations) acts on
%$\poly{\K}{\mathbb{A}}$ by permuting the indeterminates.
%
%Natural examples are polynomials whose indeterminates are indexed by the
%natural numbers (with inequality), or the rationals (with inequality). In this
%setting, \kl{effective oligomorphcity} means that \todo{do it}. The fact that
%$(\mon{\mathbb{A}}, \gdivleq)$ is a well-quasi-ordering corresponds to ordering
%\emph{finite substructures} of $\mathbb{A}$ by the \emph{labelled induced
%substructure} relation, and asking whether the class obtained is
%well-quasi-ordered. This is a well-studied question in graph theory, where a
%conjecture of Pouzet states that this holds with two labels if and only if it
%holds for every ordinal. In particular, for such structures, it is therefore
%conjectured that $(\mon{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$ is a well-quasi-ordering if and
%only if $(\mon[\om \ordplus \ordfin{1}]{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$, $(\mon[\om
%\ordplus \om]{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$, and $(\mon[\om^2]{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$ are
%well-quasi-orderings too.

\paragraph{On reducts of structures.} \AP Let $\sigma$ be a finite relational
signature, and $\tau \subseteq \sigma$ be another finite relational signature.
Let $\mathbb{A}, \mathbb{B}$ be respectively a $\sigma$ and a $\tau$ structure. We say
that \intro{$\mathbb{B}$ is a reduct of $\mathbb{A}$} when $\mathbb{B}$ is
obtained from $\mathbb{A}$ by keeping the same universe, and relations. It was noted by \cite[Lemma 13]{GHOLAS24} that in
this case, the \kl{equivariant Hilbert basis property} transfers from
$\mathbb{A}$ to $\mathbb{B}$. Let us briefly argue that this transfer holds too
for our \cref{thm:decide-equiv-ideal-mem,thm:compute-egb}.

\arka{The next lemma should be rewritten, right?}
\todo[inline]{yes, it should be rephrased}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:reducts-equiv-hilbert}
  Let $\mathbb{A}$ be a relational structure, let $\mathbb{B}$ be a 
  \kl(struct){reduct} of $\mathbb{A}$. Then, if $\mathbb{A}$ satisfies the
  hypotheses of \cref{thm:decide-equiv-ideal-mem},
  then one can decide the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} for
  $\poly{\K}{\mathbb{B}}$. Similarly, 
  if $\mathbb{A}$ satisfies the hypotheses of
  \cref{thm:compute-egb}, then one can compute an
  \kl{equivariant Gröbner basis} of an
  \kl{equivariant ideal} of $\poly{\K}{\mathbb{B}}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \todo[inline]{Just write it, and it works.}
\end{proof}

\AP 
As a consequence, one can apply our results to structures that are not equipped 
with an ordering, because one can always consider the 

\todo[inline]{Talk about $\N$ I guess.}

\paragraph{Computable oligomorphicity}
%
The structures mentioned in \Cref{ex:eq atoms,ex:dlo,ex:int,ex:rado,ex:bit vector,ex:dense trr} are \kl{homogenous} over a finite signature and every and hence \kl{oligomorphic} ().
%


\subsection{Applications}


\paragraph{Polynomial computations.} \AP The fact that (finite control) systems
performing polynomial computations can be verified follows from the theory of
\kl{Gröbner bases} on finitely many indeterminates \cite{MULSEI02,BEDUSHWO17}.
There were also numerous applications to automata theory, such as deciding
whether a weighted automaton could be determinised (resp. desambiguated)
\cite{BESM23,PUSM24}. We refer the readers to a nice survey recapitulating the
successes of the so-called ``Hilbert method'' automata theory \cite{BOJAN19}. A
natural consequence of the effective computations of \kl{equivariant Gröbner
bases} is that one can apply the same decision techniques to \emph{orbit finite
polynomial computations}. For simplicity and clarity, we will focus on
\kl{polynomial automata} without states or zero-tests \cite{BEDUSHWO17}, but
the same reasoning would apply to more general systems as we will discuss in
\cref{rem:topological-wsts}.


\AP Before discussing the case of orbit finite polynomial automata, let us
recall in \cref{ex:polynomial-automata} the setting of \kl{polynomial automata}
in the classical case, as studied by \cite{BEDUSHWO17}, with techniques that
dates back to \cite{MULSEI02}. A \intro{polynomial automaton} is a tuple $A
\defined (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where $Q = \K^n$ for some finite $n \in
\N$, $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet, $\delta \colon Q \times \Sigma \to Q$ is a
transition function such that $\delta(\cdot,a)_i$ is a polynomial in the
indeterminates $q_1, \dots, q_n$ for every $a \in \Sigma$ and every $i \in
\set{1, \dots, n}$, $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state, and $F \colon Q \to \K$
is a polynomial function describing the final result of the automaton. The
\intro{zeroness problem for polynomial automata} is the following decision
problem: given a \kl{polynomial automaton} $A$, is it true that for all words
$w \in \Sigma^*$, the polynomial $F(\delta^*(q_0, w))$ is zero? It is known
that the \kl{zeroness problem for polynomial automata} is decidable
\cite{BEDUSHWO17}, using the theory of \kl{Gröbner bases} on finitely many
indeterminates. Let us now propose a new model of computation called \kl{orbit
finite polynomial automata}, and prove an analogue decidability result.

\AP Let us fix a group $\group$ that acts on the set of indeterminates
$\Indets$, and on an alphabet $\Sigma$ in an \kl{effectively oligomorphic}
fashion. We write $\K^{(\Indets)}$ for the set of finitely supported functions
from $\Indets$ to $\K$, i.e., the set of functions $f \colon \Indets \to \K$
such that there exists a finite set $S \subseteq \Indets$ such that $f(x) = 0$
for every $x \notin S$. Given an element $f \in \K^{(\Indets)}$, and given a
polynomial $p \in \poly{\K}{\Indets}$, we write $p(f)$ for the evaluation of
$p$ on $f$.

\todo[inline]{for arka: we never defined finitely supported functions.}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:orbit-finite-polynomial-automaton}
  An \reintro{orbit finite polynomial
  automaton} is a tuple $A \defined (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where $Q =
  \K^{(\Indets)}$, $\Sigma$ is an \kl{orbit finite} alphabet, $\delta \colon
  \Sigma \to (\Indets \to \poly{\K}{\Indets})$ is a \kl(func){finitely supported}
  polynomial update function, and $F \in \poly{\K}{\Indets}$ is a polynomial
  computing the result of the automaton. 

  Given a letter $a \in \Sigma$ and a
  state $q \in Q$, the update $\delta^*(q,a)$ is defined as the function from
  $\Indets$ to $\K$ defined by $\delta^*(q,a) \colon x \mapsto \delta(a,x)[ q ]$,
  which is well-defined because $\delta(a,x)$ is a \kl{finitely supported}
  polynomial. The update function is naturally extended to words. Finally, the
  output of an \kl{orbit finite polynomial automaton} on a word $w \in \Sigma^*$
  is defined as $F(\delta^*(q_0, w))$.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
  \label{ex:orbit-finite-polynomial-automata}
  Let $\Indets = \calQ$, and let $\group$ be the group of all
  order-preserving bijections of $\calQ$.
  Let $\Sigma \defined \calQ \times \calQ$.
  Then, the following function are computable by 
  \kl{orbit finite polynomial automata}:
  the number $\mathrm{inc}(w)$ of letters $(a,b)$ such that $a < b$ in a word $w \in \Sigma^*$,
  the number $\mathrm{dec}(w)$ of letters $(a,b)$ such that $a > b$ in a word $w \in \Sigma^*$,
  and the number $(\mathrm{inc}(w) - \mathrm{dec}(w))^2$.
\end{example}

\AP As for \kl{polynomial automata}, the \intro(ofpa){zeroness problem} for
orbit finite polynomial automata is the following decision problem: decide if
for every input word $w$, the output $F(\delta^*(q_0, w))$ is zero. Solving the
\kl(ofpa){zeroness problem} for orbit finite polynomial automata allows us to
decide the equality of two such automata, by computing their difference. Let us
prove that the \kl(ofpa){zeroness problem} is decidable for \kl{orbit finite
polynomial automata}.

\todo[inline]{the proof of the following is incorrect and I do not know
  how to fix it easily}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{cor:orbit-finite-polynomial-automata-zeroness}
  Let $\Indets$ be a set of indeterminates that satisfies the
  \kl{computability assumptions} and such that $(\mon[Y]{\Indets}, \gdivleq)$ is a
  \kl{well-quasi-ordering}, for every \kl{well-quasi-ordered} set $(Y, \leq)$.
  Then, the \kl(ofpa){zeroness problem} is decidable for all \kl{orbit finite polynomial automata}
  with register names in $\Indets$, for every \kl{orbit finite} alphabet $\Sigma$,
  that is \kl{effectively oligomorphic} with respect to the action of $\group$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ be an \kl{orbit finite polynomial
  automaton}. Following the classical \emph{backward procedure} for such
  systems, we will compute a sequence of sets $E_0 \defined \setof{ q \in Q }{
  F(q) = 0 }$, and $E_{i+1} \defined \mathrm{pre}^\forall(E_i) \cap E_i$, where
  $\mathrm{pre}^\forall(E)$ is the set of states $q \in Q$ such that for every
  $a \in \Sigma$, $\delta^*(q,a) \in E$. We will prove that the sequence of
  sets $E_i$ stabilises, and that it is computable. As an immediate
  consequence, it suffices to check that $q_0 \in E_{\infty}$, where $E_\infty$
  is the limit of the sequence $(E_i)_{i \in \N}$, to decide the
  \kl(ofpa){zeroness problem}.

  The only idea of the proof is to notice that all the sets $E_i$ are
  representable as zero-sets of \kl{equivariant ideals} in
  $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$, allowing us to leverage the effective computations of
  \cref{cor:equivariant-ideals-computations}. Given a set $H$ of polynomials,
  we write $\mathcal{V}(H)$ the collections of states $q \in Q$ such that $p(q)
  = 0$ for all $p \in H$.
  It is easy to see that $E_0 = \mathcal{V}(\set{F}) = \mathcal{V}(\idl_0)$,
  where $\idl_0$ is the \kl{equivariant ideal} generated by $F$. 
  Furthermore, assuming that $E_i = \mathcal{V}(\idl_i)$, we can
  see that 
  \begin{align*}
    \mathrm{pre}^\forall(E_i) 
    & = \setof{ q \in Q }{ \forall a \in \Sigma, \delta^*(q,a) \in E_i } \\
    & = \setof{ q \in Q }{ \forall a \in \Sigma, \forall p \in \idl_i, p(\delta^*(q,a)) = 0 } \\
    & = \setof{ q \in Q }{ \forall p' \in \idl[J], p'(q) = 0 }
  \end{align*}
  Where, the \kl{equivariant ideal} $\idl[J]$ is generated by the
  polynomials $\mathrm{pullback}(p,a) \defined p [ x \mapsto \delta(a)(x)]$
  for every pair $(p, a) \in \idl_i \times \Sigma$. 
  As a consequence, we have $E_{i+1} = \mathcal{V}(\idl_{i+1})$, where
  $\idl_{i+1} = \idl_i + \idl[J]$.

  Because the sequence $\seqof{ \idl_i }[ i \in \N]$ is increasing, and thanks
  to the \kl{equivariant Hilbert basis property} of $\poly{\K}{\Indets}$, there
  exists an $n_0 \in \N$ such that $\idl_{n_0} = \idl_{n_0 + 1} = \idl_{n_0 +
  2} = \cdots$. In particular, we do have $E_{n_0} = E_{n_0 + 1} = E_{n_0 + 2}
  = \cdots$.

  Let us argue that we can compute the sequence $\idl_i$ effectively.
  First,  $\idl_0 = \EqIdlGen{F}$ is finitely represented.
  Now, 
  given an \kl{equivariant ideal} $\idl$, represented by an \kl{orbit finite}
  set of generators $H$,
  we can compute the \kl{equivariant ideal} $\idl[J]$ generated by the
  polynomials $\mathrm{pullback}(p,a) \defined p [ x_i \mapsto \delta(a)(x_i)]$
  for every pair $(p, a) \in H \times \Sigma$. Indeed, $H \times \Sigma$ is
  \kl{orbit finite} because the action of $\group$ on $\Indets$ is
  \kl{effectively oligomorphic}, and the function $\mathrm{pullback}$ is
  computable and \kl(func){equivariant}: indeed, given $\gelem \in \group$, we can
  show that
  \begin{align*}
    \gelem \cdot \mathrm{pullback}(p, a) & = 
    \gelem \cdot (p [ x_i \mapsto \delta(a)(x_i)]) \\
    & = p [ x_i \mapsto (\gelem \cdot \delta(a, x_i))] \\
    & = p [ x_i \mapsto \delta(\gelem \cdot a, \gelem \cdot x_i))] \\
    & = (\gelem \cdot p) [ x_i \mapsto \delta(\gelem \cdot a, x_i)] \\
    & = \mathrm{pullback}(\gelem \cdot p, \gelem \cdot a).
  \end{align*}
  
  Finally, one can detect when the sequence stabilises, by checking whether
  $\idl_i = \idl_{i+1}$, which is decidable because the
  \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} is decidable 
  by \cref{thm:compute-egb}.

  To conclude, it remains to check whether $q_0 \in E_\infty$,
  which amounts to check that $q_0 \in \mathcal{V}(\idl_\infty)$.
  This is equivalent to checking whether for every element $p \in \Basis$
  where $\Basis$ is an \kl{equivariant Gröbner basis} of $\idl_\infty$, we have
  $p(q_0) = 0$, which can be done by enumerating relevant orbits.

\begin{remark}
  \label{rem:topological-wsts}
  The notion of
  \intro{topological well-structured transition system} was introduced by
  Goubault-Larrecq in \cite{JGL07}, noticing that the pre-existing notion of
  \kl{Noetherian space} could serve as a topological generalisation of
  \kl{Noetherian rings} (where ideal-based method can be applied),
  and 
  \kl{well-quasi-orderings}, for which the celebrated decision procedures on
  \kl{well-structured transition systems} can be applied \cite{ABDU96}. In particular,
  Goubault-Larrecq used such systems to verify properties of \emph{polynomial
  programs} computing over the complex numbers, that can communicate over lossy
  channels using a finite alphabet \cite{JGL10}. 
  Because of \cref{cor:equivariant-ideals-computations}, we do have an 
  effective way to compute on the topological spaces at hand, 
  and therefore we can apply the theory of
  \kl{topological well-structured transition systems} to verify systems
  such as \emph{orbit finite polynomial automata communicating using a finite alphabet
  over lossy channels}.
  We refer to \cite[Chapter 9]{JGL13} for a survey on the theory of 
  Noetherian spaces.
