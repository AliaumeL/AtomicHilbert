\section{Nullstellensatz without Hilbert's basis property}
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Recall Serge Langs results on Nullstellensatz with infinitely many variables.
    \item Give example of proper ideal which does not have an equivariant zero set.
    \item As a consequence show that it is not contained in any maximal ideal that is equivariant.
    \item As a consequence, the equivariantly maximal ideal that contains it is not maximal.
\end{enumerate}
