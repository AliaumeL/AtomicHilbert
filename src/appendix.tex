%\begin{proofof}{lem:mon-rewrite-red-membership}
%  Let $R$ be a monomial rewrite system, and let $\monelt_s, \monelt_t \in
%  \mon{\Indets}$ be two monomials. We can encode the problem of deciding whether
%  $\monelt_s$ can be rewritten into $\monelt_t$ using the rules of $R$ as an
%  instance of the \kl{equivariant ideal membership problem} as follows:
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item Let $H$ be the set of all polynomials of the form $\monelt - \monelt'$
%      for all pairs
%      $(\monelt, \monelt') \in R$.
%    \item Then, we ask whether $\monelt_s - \monelt_t$ belongs to the ideal generated by $H$.
%  \end{itemize}
%
%  It is clear that if $\monelt_s$ can be rewritten into $\monelt_t$ using the
%  rules of $R$, then $\monelt_s - \monelt_t$ belongs to the equivariant ideal generated by
%  $H$. Conversely, if $\monelt_s - \monelt_t$ belongs to the ideal generated by
%  $H$, then 
%  \begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:mon-rewrite-red-membership}
%    \monelt_s - \monelt_t 
%    = 
%    \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \monelt[n]_i (\gelem_i \cdot \monelt_i - \gelem_i \cdot \monelt'_i)
%    \quad .
%  \end{equation}
%
%  Let us write the (finite) graph $G$ whose vertices are the monomials
%  $\monelt[n] (\gelem_i \cdot \monelt_i)$ and $\monelt[n] (\gelem_i \cdot
%  \monelt'_i)$, and whose edges are the directed weighted edges labelled by
%  $a_i$ (in a direction that makes the weight positive).
%
%  Let us now analyse \cref{eq:mon-rewrite-red-membership}, and notice that
%  identifying monomials in the left and right-hand sides of the equation allows
%  us to show that $\monelt_s$ and $\monelt_t$ are vertices of $G$. Furthermore,
%  we deduce that the sum of the weights of the edges having $\monelt_s$ as a
%  source or target equals $1$, and that the sum of the weights of the edges
%  having $\monelt_t$ as a source or target equals $-1$. Finally, for every
%  vertex $v$ of $G$ that is not $\monelt_s$ or $\monelt_t$, the sum of the
%  weights of the edges having $v$ as a source or target is $0$, again because
%  of an analysis of the coefficient of the monomial $v$ in the sum of
%  \cref{eq:mon-rewrite-red-membership}.
%
%  Hence, the graph $G$ is a flow network, with a flow value of at least $1$
%  from $\monelt_s$ to $\monelt_t$. As a consequence, there must exist a path
%  from $\monelt_s$ to $\monelt_t$ in $G$, which is a witness
%  of the fact that 
%  one can rewrite $\monelt_s$ into $\monelt_t$ using the rules of $R$.
