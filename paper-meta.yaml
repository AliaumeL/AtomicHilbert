abstract: |
  Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field, $\mathcal{X}$ be an infinite set (of indeterminates),
  and $\mathcal{G}$ be a group acting on $\mathcal{X}$.
  An ideal in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{K}[\mathcal{X}]$ is called equivariant if it is invariant under the action of $\mathcal{G}$.
  We show Gröbner bases for equivariant ideals are computable are hence the equivariant ideal 
  membership is decidable when $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{X}$ satisfies the Hilbert's basis property, that is, when
  every equivariant ideal in $\mathbb{K}[\mathcal{X}]$ is finitely generated.
  Moreover, we give a sufficient condition for the undecidability of the equivariant ideal membership problem.
  This condition is satisfied by the most common examples not satisfying the Hilbert’s basis property.
  Our results imply decidability of solvability of orbit-finite systems of linear equations and the reachability problem for reversible data Petri nets for a large class of data domains.
