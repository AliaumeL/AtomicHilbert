abstract: |
  Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field, $\mathcal{X}$ be an infinite set (of indeterminates),
  and $\mathcal{G}$ be a group acting on $\mathcal{X}$.
  An ideal in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{K}[\mathcal{X}]$ is called equivariant if it is invariant under the action of $\mathcal{G}$.
  We show Gröbner bases for equivariant ideals are computable are hence the equivariant ideal 
  membership is decidable when $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{X}$ satisfies the Hilbert's basis property, that is, when
  every equivariant ideal in $\mathbb{K}[\mathcal{X}]$ is finitely generated.
  Moreover, we give a sufficient condition for the undecidability of the equivariant ideal membership problem.
  This condition is satisfied by the most common examples not satisfying the Hilbert’s basis property.
