abstract: |
  Polynomials with infinite number of variables do not have the
  Hilbert basis property. However, if the variables are considered
  up to the action of a group, one can focus on the equivariant
  ideals, for which it has recently been proven that
  they do have the Hilbert basis property, under mild
  assumptions on the group action. We extend this result
  by showing that the ideal membership problem (that is, given a polynomial,
  does it belong to a given equivariant ideal) is decidable
  under similar assumptions. This is significant because
  it paves the way towards decision procedures based on the Hilbert
  method in the presence of infinite data structures with symmetries.
