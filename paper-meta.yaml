abstract: |
  The ring of polynomials in infinitely many variables over a field 
  is never
  Noetherian. However, it is often the case that the set of indeterminates
  comes equipped with an additional structure. This extra structure 
  can be taken into account by the means of a group action on the 
  indeterminates, and by considering polynomials up to this action.
  In this setting, one can recover Noetherianity by restricting the attention
  to equivariant ideals, under mild assumptions on the group action, as shown by Ghosh and Lasota in 2024.
  We extend this result by proving algorithmic counterparts to this theoretical result: 
  we show that one can decide the equivariant membership problem,
  and that one can even compute equivariant Gröbner bases,
  under similar assumptions as the ones made by Ghosh and Lasota.
  In addition to these positive results, we also establish sufficient
  conditions for the equivariant membership problem to be undecidable.
  Finally, we discuss how these computational results can be applied 
  to various mathematical and computer science decidability problems.
