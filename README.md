> Equivariant Ideal Membership: Hilbert at the atomic age

We prove that under mild assumptions on the set of variables, the *equivariant
membership problem* is decidable.â€¯That is, given a polynomial $P$ and a finite
set $S$ of polynomials, it is decidable whether $S$ belongs in the
*equivariant* ideal generated by $S = \{ s_1, \dots, s_n\ = \{ s_1, \dots,
s_n\}}$, i.e., whether there exists coefficients $q_i \in \mathbb{Q}$ and
polynomials $p_i \in \mathbb{Q}[\mathcal{X}]$ such that:

$$
P = \sum_{i=1}^n q_i p_i s_i
$$
